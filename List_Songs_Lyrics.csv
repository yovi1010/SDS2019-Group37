4,"(Sing this with me  this is ""40"")

Waited patiently for the Lord
Inclined and heard my cry
He lift me up out of the pit
Out of the mire and clay

I will sing  sing a new song
I will sing  sing a new song

How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long  how long  how long
How long to sing this song?

He set my feet upon a rock
And made my footsteps firm
Many will see
Many will see and hear

I will sing  sing a new song
I will sing  sing a new song

(Sing it)

How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long  how long  how long

8,"Have you seen my hands?
Just look at 'em shake.
And the song just keeps on repeating 
Drop the needle again.
And I dance with your ghost 
Oh  but that ain't the way 
I can't move on and I can't stay the same.

And all my friends say

""Hey hey  turn the record over.
Hey hey  and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go  turn the key and engine over.
Let her go  let somebody else lay at her feet.""

Have you seen my heart 
Have you seen how it bleeds?
And the nights are so long  baby 
Out here in the deep.
The tick  ticking of hours  lonely.
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms.

21,"I often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise  or Basingstoke or Reading

I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
And there in the buffet car
I wait for eternity  or Basingstoke or Reading

I often dream of trains till it gets light
Summer turns to winter overnight
The leaves falls so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock  exactly what I'm dreading

I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor  I'm waiting for you baby...","""I Often Dream of Trains""",2007,Rock

Paralyzed and floating in the air
Or I thought
'Cause no one really knows
I couldn't stop

So I wanted her
To feel the breeze
Just blowing through the trees

We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance

So I waited there
Burdened by some things I shouldn't care about
I brushed them off
And dug my heart back out

We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
Everything is debatable

I seem kinda strange
I saw the other side
Floating around in the room
I realized
You thought I'd look the same
Despite some flashing lights
Floating around over you

It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
I saw the other side
The other side and beyond  oh

125,Like animals Tonight we make it You give me an inch  I'm gonna take it  I'll steal your love Like a thief To be as one Is my belief  Don't look back and have no regrets Like beasts of prey we must feed on it I'll be your one  your one and only To feel me burn come close and hold me  [Chorus] Flesh and blood sacrifice Melts the heart like fire and ice Flesh and blood like fire to ice Are you willing to sacrifice  There's no more time  Don't think about The flame will die If you doubt  It's a game of Love and hate To lose it all's A chance we take  Come to me and take my hand It's in the fire that we must stand I'll take you down under my gun Our flesh and blood will be as one  [Chorus]  Our blood runs deeper than a river The less you need the more I'm gonna give you And give you but good  [Chorus],(Flesh and Blood) Sacrifice,2008,Rock
126,Didn't have the money round to buy a Morry Thou Been around and seen a lot to shake me anyhow Begged and borrowed sometimes  I admit I even stole The worse crime that I ever did was playing rock 'n roll.  But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself  Suffering convictions on a two-way stretch inside The air in here is pretty thin  I think I'll go outside Committed for insanity and crimes against the soul The worst crime that I ever did was play some rock 'n roll.  But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself  And you should know  Now I find from week to week the sentence sticking fast Turn the corner  rub my eyes and hope the world will last Stranger from another planet welcome to our hole Just strap on your guitar and we'll play some rock 'n roll  But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself  And you should know,(Get A) Grip (On Yourself),1979,Rock
127,Living on through politics  Body-guarded  heart in bits  A blue-eyed honesty  Indigo injury  The family tree is felled  Bereavement worn so well  Giving up on certainty  Wilderness society   Wearing the fame like a loaded gun  Tied up with a rosary  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   Imagine being a Kennedy  Rule without remedy  To watch your family die  The world loves a sacrifice  Prophets longing for the three  Honoring the tragedy  They hunger for the crime  The privilege to take a life   Wearing the fame like a loaded gun  Tied up with a rosary  Ooh  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   And is not peace basically  A matter of human rights?  The right to live out our lives  Without fear of devastation?  The right to breathe air  As nature provided it?  The right of future generations  To a healthy existence?  Let us if we can step back from  The shadows of war and seek out  The way of peace  I love the look in your eyes  I can see your soul sometimes and we laugh  When we try too hard we stop and start  Oh imagine being a Kennedy  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   Wearing the fame like a loaded gun  Tied up with a rosary  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   Imagine being a Kennedy  Ooh I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   The cost of freedom is always high   Yet one path we shall never choose  That is the path of surrender or submission.  When a man's way please the lord   The scriptures tell us   He maketh even his enemies  To be at peace with him'.  We will not prematurely or unnecessarily  Risk the course of worldwide nuclear war  In which even the fruits of victory  Would be ashes in our mouths  Ashes in our mouths Ashes in our mouths Ashes in our mouths,(Glad I'm) Not a Kennedy,1988,Rock

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says  I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very  very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right
Smeared mascara  I looked into your eyes  I saw a light

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard  to let them use the pool all day for free

Then the conversation stopped  and I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
And I said girl!

So make a move  (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night

We watched Titanic  and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy  you took me home to meet your Mom and Dad

Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much  I took some for the team
Your dad was silent  his eyes were fixed on what was on TV

Then the conversation stopped  and I looked down at the ring

There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops  and we're facing our defeat
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me

Drifting between sleep and waking
Your absence brought me to
Sick feelings filled me
Slowly remembering the bitterness of the final kiss 
Motionless
We never said goodbye
When we gave in  but we don't mind
If we never say goodbye 
There'll be no end  there'll be no end

Stream of consciousness
Leads me to drowning dreams
Looking up  you're colored baby-blue
The frustration of knowing what it's like to breathe you in 
Remember then  remember when you let me in
Hold on  hold on  we can be strong dig our fingers deep into each other

There was no more fear of flying
Once the final word were spoke
There was no more tears of crying
It had all become a joke
Though they took a vow of silence
Still the rumours quickly spread
There was no more point in trying
For the great affair was dead
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more fears and pain
There was no more need for spying
They had everything to gain
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more tortured brow
They had dropped the safety curtain
They had killed the sacred cow
There was everything to live for
There was nothing to explain
They had left the scene  triumphant
They would live to fight again

291,[B-Real talking] A lot of a  sharks out there  try'na take a bite of somethin' What's hot Lot of chameleons out there  try'na change up Anytime somethin' new comes along  everybody wants a bite Don't happen overnight  [Chorus] So you want to be a rock superstar?  And live large  A big house. Five cars  You're in charge.  Comin' up in the world.  Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly  I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up Looking in the mirror  dreaming about blowin' up  The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys.  Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me. Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest  And the games that be comin' with it  Nevertheless  you got to go for the gusto  But you don't know about the blood  sweat  and tears and  Losin' some of your peers.  And losin' some of yourself to the years past  gone by  Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy  Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act  Shit's deep  48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal  Think he's gonna make a mil but never will  'Til he crosses over  still  Fillin' your head with fantasies  Come with me  Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's   You want to be a rock superstar in the biz  And take shit from people who don't know what it is  I wish it was all fun and games  But the price of fame is high  And some can't pay the way  Feel trapped in What you rappin' about?  Tell me what happened when you lost clout?  The route you took started collapsing  No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and Everybody shits on your name.   [Chorus: x2]  People see rock stars  you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out  More like everybody else  you know  its a fun job  but its still a job. There's  Gonna be another cat comin' out  Looking like me  sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside  Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.  You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream?  Big shot  heavy hitter on the mainstream  You want to look trendy in the Bentley  Be a star band  never act friendly.  You want to have big fame  Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains  First they get played like all damn day  Long as you sell everything will be ok  Then you get dissed by the media and fans  Things never stay the same way they began  I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest  That's why fools end up dining on a bullet  Think everything's fine in the big time  See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine  So you roll far and live large  It ain't all that goes with being a rock star  [Chorus: x2]  My own son don't know me  I'm chillin' in a hotel room  lonely  But I thank God I'm with my homies  But sometimes I wish I was back home  But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love  They're phony  Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony  I'm in the middle like Monie  And the press say that my own people disown me  The best way back to keep your head straight  Never inflate the cranium  They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium  Who just want to cling on  swing on  and so on  Go on fall off - the ho's fall off  To the next rock superstar with no shame  Give him a year and they'll be right out the game  The same as the last one who came before him  Gained fame started getting' ignored  I warned him  Asured him this ain't easy  Take it from the weazy  Sleazy people want to be so cheesy  They're f*cking evil  Assassins  assassins  [Chorus: x2],(Rock) Superstar,2000,Rock

333,"It was a relic of another time
Plundered from an ancient tomb
Wrought by forgotten arts
Inscribed with cryptic runes

They called us fierce marauders
Warp riders and guns for hire
Before the sky cried tears of fire

Looking out across the void
We beheld a fearsome sight
Two armadas arrayed before us
Preparing to unleash their might

The Lady kept her promise
We heard the sound of a cosmic choir
The night the sky cried tears of fire

This is the hour of the Phoenix
When all must be reborn in flame
And though they did not know it
Nothing could remain the same

The captain has his vengeance
Aw we drift through a sea of pyres
The stars will always remember
When the sky cried tears of fire",(The Night the Sky Cried) Tears of Fire,2010,Rock

And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it's a lot of yearning
Your face  the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me  like that's what I'm about

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

It's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight  open fire  turn in the spitfire  open fire
Scream without making a sound  open fire  be up here without looking down  open fire
Oh afraid of heights

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

Swishing through the rye grass
With thoughts of mouse and apple pie
Tail balancing at half-mast

And the mouse police never sleeps
Lying in the cherry tree
Savage bed foot warmer
Of purest feline ancestry

Look out  little furry folk
He's the all night working cat
Eats but one in every ten
Leaves the others on the mat

And the mouse police never sleeps
Waiting by the cellar door
Window-box town crier
Birth and death registrar

With claws that rake a furrow red
Licensed to mutilate
From warm milk on a lazy day
To dawn patrol on hungry hate

No  the mouse police never sleeps
Climbing on the ivy
Windy roof top weathercock
Warm blooded night on a cold tile

Frozen their veins.
Still closing helplessly afar 
Waking the creatures within.

I am a lonely traveller 
Awaiting to sleep eternally.
Under those cold woods 
As my fall brings them.

Shadows of their wings 
As howling their pleeds.
Wounded  I lay on ground
Listening their needs

It's dark and cold
And they fly slowly
The way they were told.
To feast mine fleshly dreaming.
And they know surely 
They raped mine soul.

Because not everything that goes around  comes back around you know

All the promises of stone  crumble in the light

I'm in trouble now
and it cannot wait

Well I can't wait
To see this through

I don't even know why
Talk back at the ocean

Catch a glow
Oh no  baby  oh no no

To figure out my state
Oh I know
She's ten days late
And I don't know
Where to take it
But it's still great
Knowing you
She's ten days late

Time has come for you to choose
Baby daddies keep your boo
Many blessings come to you
Baby daddy keep your boo
Your eyes look to me for what to do
I can't lie
I don't know
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
No one's laughing
Now what do I say
I walk away but  oh no
Don't go

Talk back at the ocean

I guess I'll always be

544,"Listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there  not like you

Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy  spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice  these hypocrites won't see

But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one
Who illuminated your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine  a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely
On your way your way home

Oh  what are they going to do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way  but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray  Heaven knows when to lift you out
10  000 days in the fire is long enough  you're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates saying  ""I've come home now
Fetch me the spirit  the son  and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended  it's time now
My time now  give me my  give me my wings""

You are the light and way that they will only read about

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
(With the)
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers
You were my witness  my eyes  my evidence
Judith Marie  unconditional one

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion but
Should you see your Maker's face tonight
Look Him in the eye  look Him in the eye and tell Him
""I never lived a lie  never took a life but surely saved one
Hallelujah  it's time for You to bring me home""

I hope Sam's a famous actor one day...  Sometimes I dream I'm driving across the water In a car with my dad or my brother... Sometimes you dream you're in a foreign country And you packed all the wrong clothes...

Picking myself apart Waiting for you to get home from work...  Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York I don't know what to do with do-nothing days I suppose there's no such thing anymore anyway...

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses  leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle  watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though  there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

I'll be back for all y'all...",12,1995,Rock

Merry Christmas to everyone
Yeah man
You having a good year?
Yeah  it just feels good to be next to you here on the holidays
Hearing you say merry Christmas
It just warms my heart  man
It's like soul food  like fired okra
Dude  I'm having a great holiday this year  it's awesome
Yeah man  so you wanna sing for these people or what?
Yeah  here we go  okay

On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree
I don't even know what a partridge is  to be honest
A partridge is a bird
I think it's a bird that doesn't fly
Like Danny Bonaduce?
Um  no  it's
He's ripped  ripped I'm telling you
I heard he's a little  you know  fallen on the deep end  maybe
Oh  yeah  well
He's gonna kick my ass now
No  it's against that napoleon complex  he's short

So  on the  on the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
Turtle doves?
They're nice  do they have shells?
Uh  I don't know

But  on the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
From now on can you sing
""And a Danny Bonaduce""?

On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce
That's good! Yeah  yeah  it works  the syllables

Yeah  so I started to wonder
If my true love  my old lady
Was going to get me anything
Other than a bunch of birds
Yeah  they're all  like  pooping everywhere and stuff  it's gross
They're hard to clean up after
So far she got me four calling birds 
French hens  turtle doves
The French hens  which are the French hens
They're eating all your cheese
Drinking up all your wine
Like all hours of the day
I love France
So  I was wondering when
She was going to get me something good

And on the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings
Nice!
Yeah  I was finally happy
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a par-Danny Bonaduce

So  like  with the five golden rings
That's kinda nice
Yeah  but on the sixth day  she started getting-
Like Lil Wayne
Or what's another rapper
That has like a bunch of silly jewelry?
Um  I don't know any  man

But  on the sixth day
It kinda went downhill
And the seventh cause she got me
Six geese a-laying
Geese a-laying?
Like laying down?
No  like  geese that are laying
Like  oh  like
That's gross  yeah  I don't know about that
And then on the seventh day-
I often wonder how geese would go about doing that
If you're picking up what I'm putting down
I-I don't want to talk about it  man  okay

On the seventh day?
Seventh day
Seven swans swimming
More birds!
Swimming?
I hate it

On the eight day it got really weird
Cause on the eight day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eight maids a-milking
What?! Yeah!
What  are they milking the geese cause they're laying?
I think they're like lactating or something
I don't get that  yeah
I'm not into it

But  on the ninth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Nine ladies dancing
Nice! Okay  cool
Oh  well that explains the maids a-milking
No  these were like exotic dancers
Like you can see on the internet
Yeah  it was nice
There was like one of those poles and all that stuff
Yeah  but this is your old lady
That's getting you all these things  that's kinda weird
I know  but she's looking out for me  you know
Tenth day  tenth day  okay

On the tenth day it got crazy again
Cause she gave me ten lords a -leaping
Like the dark lords?
I don't know
That's so weird  and then the eleventh day
Pipers piping
Pipers piping?
These are  by far  the strangest gifts I have ever received
I don't understand-
Wait  like  laying pipe?
No  that's the geese that are laying pipe
Oh  well maybe they're laying it with the pipers
Which would be weird all together

But  on the twelfth day of Christmas
This is the last day
My true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Everybody could use a good drummer
Yeah  I could use twelve drummers  yeah
The Grateful Dead had two drummers
Dude  Slipknot has like ten  yeah
Did you get to  like  choose which drummers
Or are they just studio guys?
I think they were pretty bad ass
Oh  cool
I mean  not that Mark's not
I mean  Mark's kicking some ass  yeah
You know
Was he one of the twelve?
Um  I don't know  but

So  let's go down the list
And finish this godforsaken song off
Oh  okay and wish everyone a very merry Christmas

Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Let's give it up for the ladies dancing
Go ladies! Okay
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce

To draw my thoughts  I'll gather and tell
Like bricks that I've laid to build my life
Those that crumbled only caused me strife

Thoughts became words  cast into the sea
But they returned  always haunting me
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore
I just don't think I can give anymore

Because I've lived  how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived  how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything  you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger  music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind  the thoughts are too real

Because I've lived  how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived  how many lives do I have to die?

And lies in the meadow with her hands tied behind her back
I won't refuse if you know how to use it
Just stop playing that ugly drug music

And everyone's a prisoner of

And a decent pair of scissors
So tonight I'm drinking to your health

She stands and fails
On fashion fingernails
Her lovers have her walking 'round
On instruments of torture
And one of them is poisonous
The other is a thief they say
So what one could give to her
The other cannot take away

When nobody knows she puts on secret clothes
And lies in her splendor for a picture opportunity
Cover up that bruise  put on patent leather shoes
Just stop playing that bad mood music baby

Left to be unwritten Like memories to unfold And I don't believe the truth It doesn't make me feel alive The truth's just overrated We've all got something to hide  'Cause lies make it so much fun So sing the praise of insincerity  Make this your last prayer As the dream becomes your worst nightmare  I'm not your savior or a saint No use praying for escape I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head Just another crying shame Life is such a deadly game Gone wrong  fire at will Put a bullet in his head  Pay me no more mind Have I really come undone?

Wishing you were seventeen. At twenty-one  it was a long time gone.  And now here you are. You're locked in your own excuse.  The circle's getting smaller every day.  You're busy planning the next fifty years.  So stay the way you are and keep your head down to the same old ground.  Just paint your picture boy until you find  A closed circle's better than an open line.   Yes stay the way you are. I got a circle that's the same as yours.  It may be bigger  but I've more to lose.

Todo lo que quiero en una simple decisión
Puede ser que tú me eleves
Yo no sé si tú me quieres

Diecisiete veces fuera de tu habitación
En cada espejo voy viendo el reflejo de mi situación
Yo no sé si tú me entiendes
Pero sé quién eres y sé lo que quieres

Viajo fuera de control
Persiguiendo la salida
Y es que no tengo el valo para decirte adiós

Peligrosamente pierdo la respiración
Se mueve el tiempo en cada momento
Y no hay explicación

Aunque sé muy bien que duele
Yo regreso a verte
No quiero perderte

Lo que duran dos peces de hielo
En un güisqui on the rocks
En vez de fingir
O  estrellarme una copa de celos
Le dio por reír
De pronto me vi
Como un perro de nadie
Ladrando  a las puertas del cielo
Me dejó un neceser con agravios
La miel en los labios
Y escarcha en el pelo

Tenían razón
Mis amantes
En eso de que  antes
El malo era yo
Con una excepción
Esta vez
Yo quería quererla querer
Y ella no
Así que se fue
Me dejó el corazón
En los huesos
Y yo de rodillas

Desde el taxi
Y  haciendo un exceso
Me tiró dos besos
Uno por mejilla
Y regresé
A la maldición
Del cajón sin su ropa
A la perdición
De los bares de copas
A las cenicientas
De saldo y esquina

Y  por esas ventas
Del fino laina
Pagando las cuentas
De gente sin alma
Que pierde la calma
Con la cocaína
Volviéndome loco
Derrochando
La bolsa y la vida
La fui  poco a poco
Dando por perdida

Y eso que yo
Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías
Para no comprarla
Con bisutería
Ni ser el fantoche
Que va  en romería
Con la cofradía

Del santo reproche
Tanto la quería
Que  tardé  en aprender
A olvidarla  diecinueve días
Y quinientas noches
Dijo hola y adiós
Y  el portazo  sonó
Como un signo de interrogación
Sospecho que  así
Se vengaba  a través del olvido
Cupido de mi
No pido perdón

¿Para qué? Si me va a perdonar
Porque ya no le importa
Siempre tuvo la frente muy alta
La lengua muy larga
Y la falda muy corta
Me abandonó
Como se abandonan
Los zapatos viejos
Destrozó el cristal
De mis gafas de lejos
Sacó del espejo
Su vivo retrato

Y  fui  tan torero
Por los callejones
Del juego y el vino
Que  ayer  el portero
Me echó del casino
De torrelodones
Qué pena tan grande
Negaría el santo sacramento
En el mismo momento
Que ella me lo mande
Y eso que yo

Paro no agobiar con

I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall 
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall 

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble 
That was brewing in the Asian way 
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A. 

In the city of the lost and found 
It's hard to get a break 
Hard to stop from getting turned around 
And make the same mistakes 

My reputation's on the line 
The final day of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso 
I practiced 61 minutes a day 
I could never reach the keys 
But it was all OK 

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother 
That could brighten up the darkest nights 
It's just another sign of love 
Whenever we would fight 

It's all the same twenty years ago 
As it is right now 
Like a tour at the closing show 
When I take my bow 

My reputation's on the line 
At the start of '79 
But like the sun  just watch me shine

732,We were young  And none of us know quite what to say  But the feeling moved Among us in silence anyway. Slowly we had made Quite a change Somewhere we had crossed a big line. Down upon our knees  We had tasted holy wine  And no one could sway us In a life time.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love had lit a fire; We were the flame. Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Not a word. And no one had to say we were changed. Nothing else we lived through Would ever be same the same  Knowing the truth That we had gained.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love had lit a fire; We were the flame. Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Stay with me. Make it ever new  So time will not undo  As the years go by  How I need to see That's still me.  Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love.  Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love has lit a fire; I am the flame. Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love has lit a fire; I am the flame.

Here?s what I know about you and all your trends 
And all the times we made believe a story 

Here?s what I think about making face 
Without a grain of doubt it?s all I think about  it?s all in my mind 
It?s best I make a sound before I hit the ground 

Run away from it all 
It?s what I think about  it?s what I know about  it?s what I care about 

Pain won?t go away even when the drugs say  I won?t regret 
Time heals so I?m told  I could never be sold  I don?t forget 

And if I should start to wonder  pull me out from the rock I?m under 

Here?s what I think about vacant space 
Without a grain of doubt it?s all I think about  it?s all in my mind 
I better hit the town before the rain comes down 

Run away from it all 
Far away from it all 

Pain won?t go away even when the drugs say  I won?t regret 
Time heals so I?m told  I could never be sold  I don?t forget 
Hey Dave  you?re so brave  I can never be saved  take it from me

You said too much

Get off the ground now baby
Just shut your mouth and maybe
This can all be done
I won't tell anyone

You showed them all
Things they shouldn't see
You lost the sense
The permanence  the flair  the ball
You showed them all

You take everything
Your car  your cash
Your shoes  your flash

When I touch it  it gives forth a sound It's got wires that vibrate and give music What can this thing be that I found?

I'm not messing no I
Need your blessing
And your promise to live free
Please do it for me

Is there a heaven a hell
And will I come back
Who can tell
Now I can see
What matters to me
It's as clear as crystal
The places I've been
The people I've seen
Plans that I made
Start to fade
The sun's setting gold
Thought I would grow old 
It wasn't to be

And I can't believe
How I've been wasting my time

With sleepy dreams

The beat keep driving

Round and round

And holding my guitar
And I can't tell
If it's Carnegie Hall
Or just some local bar
But the hands are clapping
And the place is moving
And I feel it in my soul
It's late at night
And I can't sleep
I gotta write some
Rock and roll

It's bouncing all around

While the world
Outside is quiet
And the children
Are fast asleep
But here inside
I'm rockin' 'n' rollin'
To a crazy beat

What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
""How and why""?

I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!

I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same

We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!

No hope in sight

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time

The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?

They didn't listen so they threw you away

Now all you do is talk 
I don't wanna hear your bullshit
Is this what you want?

This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation 
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all plenty alive
We know where you are and were coming
Lets see you say that shit to our face

Thirty-one fifty hates

In my own peculiar way I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where but I still don't know the when

You wanna live in a one sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now with the grand facade
I don't want to be an angel
I just want to be God

But I got too many grudges to hold!

Saw a lot of people die in the end
I never want to walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't want to have it all 
I just want to have enough

This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They told us that we wouldn't survive

Forty to one

So silent before the storm
Awaiting command
A few has been chosen to stand
As one outnumbered by far
The orders from high command
Fight back  hold your ground!

In early September it came
A war unknown to the world
No army may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone
Undone!

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

The 8th of September it starts
The rage of the Reich
A barrage of mortars and guns
Stand past  the bunkers will hold
The captain has pledged his life
I'll face my fate here!
The sound of artillery strike
So fierce
The thunder of guns

So come  bring on all that you've got
Come hell  come high water  never stop
Unless you are forty to one
Your lives will soon be undone
Undone!

Baptised in fire
40 to 1
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

Always remember  a fallen soldier
Always remember  fathers and sons at war
Always remember  a fallen soldier
Always remember  fathers and sons at war
Always remember  a fallen soldier
Always remember  buried in history

No vermin may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone
Undone!

1122,"When she said  ""Don't waste your words  they're just lies ""
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes 
Then said  ""What else you got left?""
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said  ""Don't forget 
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.""

I stood there and hummed 
I tapped on her drum
I asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot 
And straightened her suit 
Then she said  ""Don't get cute.""
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs 
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

She threw me outside 
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt 
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway  she went to get it 
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come  I asked her for some.
She said  ""No  dear.""
I said  ""Your words aren't clear 
You'd better spit out your gum.""
She screamed till her face got so red 
Then she fell on the floor 
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And you  you took me in 
You loved me then  you never wasted time.
And I  I never took much 
I never asked for your crutch
And I don't ask for mine.",4th Time Around,1994,Rock

1156,Another obituary in the paper today One more for the list of those who've already fallen Another one of our comrades is taken down Like so many others of our calling  We tweet our anecdotes  our commentary Or we sing his songs in some sad tribute While the tabloids are holding a story of kiss and tell That he's no longer able to deny or refute  50 000 voices rising every time he'd sing And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him  How well I remember the stadiums we played And the lights sweeping across a sea of 50 000 souls we'd face A serious drug that you could never kick Or one that you couldn't imagine you'd ever replace  We flew like kites on the wings of amphetamine Secured only to a bass line and a snare drum beat But really what did any of it mean? When there's a higher philosophy in reflection and defeat  50 000 voices rising every time he'd sing And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him Still believing that old lie  the one that your own face betrays Rock stars don't ever die  they only fade away  Reflecting now on my own past Inside this prison I've made of myself I'm feeling a little better today Although the bathroom mirror is telling me something else  These lines of stress  one bloodshot eye The unhealthy pallor of a troubled ghost Where did I put my spectacle case? I'm half blind and as deaf as any post  50 000 hands are raised to a man that's just like you and me We create the gods we can and gift them immortality Still believing that old lie  the one that your own face betrays Rock stars don't ever die  they only fade away,"50,000",2016,Rock

The leaves falls so suddenly
The sun sets at four o'clock  exactly what I'm dreading

Seems like forever that she's been on my mind 
But nothing has changed;
She thinks I'm a waste of her time.
There she goes; she don't know what she's missing.
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight?
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire.

Let me into your heart - oh 
There's nothing on Earth that
Should keep us apart.
I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone 
'Cause I can't live without your love.
So I wait  here for an answer 
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday.
I'll keep holding on 
But I can't go on living this way.

Paralyzed and floating in the air
Or I thought
'Cause no one really knows
I couldn't stop

So I wanted her
To feel the breeze
Just blowing through the trees

We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable

So I waited there
Burdened by some things I shouldn't care about
I brushed them off
And dug my heart back out

It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable

I seem kinda strange
I saw the other side
Floating around in the room
I realized
You thought I'd look the same
Despite some flashing lights
Floating around over you

It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We waited centuries to throw up our hands
It's such an arbitrary line that we dance
We dance we dance
Oh everything is debatable
I saw the other side
The other side and beyond  oh
Everything is debatable

1326,Didn't have the money round to buy a Morry Thou Been around and seen a lot to shake me anyhow Begged and borrowed sometimes  I admit I even stole The worse crime that I ever did was playing rock 'n roll.  But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself  Suffering convictions on a two-way stretch inside The air in here is pretty thin  I think I'll go outside Committed for insanity and crimes against the soul The worst crime that I ever did was play some rock 'n roll.  But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself  And you should know  Now I find from week to week the sentence sticking fast Turn the corner  rub my eyes and hope the world will last Stranger from another planet welcome to our hole Just strap on your guitar and we'll play some rock 'n roll  But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself But the money's no good Just get a grip on yourself  And you should know,(Get A) Grip (On Yourself),1979,Hip Hop
1327,Living on through politics  Body-guarded  heart in bits  A blue-eyed honesty  Indigo injury  The family tree is felled  Bereavement worn so well  Giving up on certainty  Wilderness society   Wearing the fame like a loaded gun  Tied up with a rosary  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   Imagine being a Kennedy  Rule without remedy  To watch your family die  The world loves a sacrifice  Prophets longing for the three  Honoring the tragedy  They hunger for the crime  The privilege to take a life   Wearing the fame like a loaded gun  Tied up with a rosary  Ooh  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   And is not peace basically  A matter of human rights?  The right to live out our lives  Without fear of devastation?  The right to breathe air  As nature provided it?  The right of future generations  To a healthy existence?  Let us if we can step back from  The shadows of war and seek out  The way of peace  I love the look in your eyes  I can see your soul sometimes and we laugh  When we try too hard we stop and start  Oh imagine being a Kennedy  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   Wearing the fame like a loaded gun  Tied up with a rosary  I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   Imagine being a Kennedy  Ooh I'm glad I'm not a Kennedy   The cost of freedom is always high   Yet one path we shall never choose  That is the path of surrender or submission.  When a man's way please the lord   The scriptures tell us   He maketh even his enemies  To be at peace with him'.  We will not prematurely or unnecessarily  Risk the course of worldwide nuclear war  In which even the fruits of victory  Would be ashes in our mouths  Ashes in our mouths Ashes in our mouths Ashes in our mouths,(Glad I'm) Not a Kennedy,1988,Hip Hop

I stood and watched her fall
Couldn't help her at all

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says  I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very  very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

Would I make you smile if I came back in style? Tell me  would you wanna sing me? Don't say I'm gone  no  I wanna live on   Somebodies got to sing me.  Let me fill the air with my old song.  Have I let you down?  Tell me  where did I go wrong?  Sing me  sing me  I got a song to be sung. Sing me  sing me  Roll me around on your tongue.  I've got sunshine  I've got a message to shout.

The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right
Smeared mascara  I looked into your eyes  I saw a light

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard  to let them use the pool all day for free

Then the conversation stopped  and I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
And I said girl!
If you're wondering if I want you to  (I want you to) I want you to
So make a move  (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night

The rest of the summer was the best we ever had
We watched Titanic  and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy  you took me home to meet your Mom and Dad

Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much  I took some for the team
Your dad was silent  his eyes were fixed on what was on TV

Then the conversation stopped  and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you  and you were right there next to me
And I said girl!

So make a move  (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night

There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops  and we're facing our defeat

Drifting between sleep and waking
Your absence brought me to
Sick feelings filled me
Slowly remembering the bitterness of the final kiss 
Motionless
We never said goodbye
When we gave in  but we don't mind
If we never say goodbye 
There'll be no end  there'll be no end

Stream of consciousness
Leads me to drowning dreams
Looking up  you're colored baby-blue
The frustration of knowing what it's like to breathe you in 
Remember then  remember when you let me in
Hold on  hold on  we can be strong dig our fingers deep into each other

There was no more fear of flying
Once the final word were spoke
There was no more tears of crying
It had all become a joke
Though they took a vow of silence
Still the rumours quickly spread
There was no more point in trying
For the great affair was dead
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more fears and pain
There was no more need for spying
They had everything to gain
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more tortured brow
They had dropped the safety curtain
They had killed the sacred cow
There was everything to live for
There was nothing to explain
They had left the scene  triumphant
They would live to fight again
There was no more fear of flying
There was no more fears and pain
There was no more need for spying
They had everything to gain

The dry cleaner wants money on the clothes
The Rolls Royce  my dear . . . need it be said?
If I were you I would think ""Mo-Ped""

But I'm gonna make a vow to stay
We gotta eat it off the floor a while
You don't even have a phone to dial
Do it in a whole new way

Your necklaces have turned to centipedes
They slowly crawled away . . .
And the bar is empty and there ain't no waiter
The ice all melts in the refrigerator
The dead meat drips
On the asparagus tips

It was dropped for a feature on Monaco's Zoo
Calvin called  he wants his hand-made vest
And it's snip snip to your American Express

Looking in the mirror dreaming about blowing up

Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be coming with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto

So the record gets pushed by Sony

And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the palladium
Who just want to cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off

Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game

Gained fame

1491,[B-Real talking] A lot of a  sharks out there  try'na take a bite of somethin' What's hot Lot of chameleons out there  try'na change up Anytime somethin' new comes along  everybody wants a bite Don't happen overnight  [Chorus] So you want to be a rock superstar?  And live large  A big house. Five cars  You're in charge.  Comin' up in the world.  Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly  I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up Looking in the mirror  dreaming about blowin' up  The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys.  Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me. Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest  And the games that be comin' with it  Nevertheless  you got to go for the gusto  But you don't know about the blood  sweat  and tears and  Losin' some of your peers.  And losin' some of yourself to the years past  gone by  Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy  Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act  Shit's deep  48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal  Think he's gonna make a mil but never will  'Til he crosses over  still  Fillin' your head with fantasies  Come with me  Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's   You want to be a rock superstar in the biz  And take shit from people who don't know what it is  I wish it was all fun and games  But the price of fame is high  And some can't pay the way  Feel trapped in What you rappin' about?  Tell me what happened when you lost clout?  The route you took started collapsing  No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and Everybody shits on your name.   [Chorus: x2]  People see rock stars  you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out  More like everybody else  you know  its a fun job  but its still a job. There's  Gonna be another cat comin' out  Looking like me  sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside  Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.  You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream?  Big shot  heavy hitter on the mainstream  You want to look trendy in the Bentley  Be a star band  never act friendly.  You want to have big fame  Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains  First they get played like all damn day  Long as you sell everything will be ok  Then you get dissed by the media and fans  Things never stay the same way they began  I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest  That's why fools end up dining on a bullet  Think everything's fine in the big time  See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine  So you roll far and live large  It ain't all that goes with being a rock star  [Chorus: x2]  My own son don't know me  I'm chillin' in a hotel room  lonely  But I thank God I'm with my homies  But sometimes I wish I was back home  But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love  They're phony  Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony  I'm in the middle like Monie  And the press say that my own people disown me  The best way back to keep your head straight  Never inflate the cranium  They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium  Who just want to cling on  swing on  and so on  Go on fall off - the ho's fall off  To the next rock superstar with no shame  Give him a year and they'll be right out the game  The same as the last one who came before him  Gained fame started getting' ignored  I warned him  Asured him this ain't easy  Take it from the weazy  Sleazy people want to be so cheesy  They're f*cking evil  Assassins  assassins  [Chorus: x2],(Rock) Superstar,2000,Hip Hop

And look like nothin's gonna come my way

Look like nothin's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same  yes

And this loneliness won't leave me alone

Just to make this dock my home

1533,"It was a relic of another time
Plundered from an ancient tomb
Wrought by forgotten arts
Inscribed with cryptic runes

They called us fierce marauders
Warp riders and guns for hire
Before the sky cried tears of fire

Looking out across the void
We beheld a fearsome sight
Two armadas arrayed before us
Preparing to unleash their might

The Lady kept her promise
We heard the sound of a cosmic choir
The night the sky cried tears of fire

This is the hour of the Phoenix
When all must be reborn in flame
And though they did not know it
Nothing could remain the same

The captain has his vengeance
Aw we drift through a sea of pyres
The stars will always remember
When the sky cried tears of fire",(The Night the Sky Cried) Tears of Fire,2010,Hip Hop

You say good things come to those who wait
I've been waiting a long time for it

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

You say your quest is to bring it higher
Well I never seen change without a fire
But from your mouth I have seen a lot of burning
But underneath I think it's a lot of yearning
Your face  the colors change from green to yellow
To the point where you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'd expect from me  like that's what I'm about

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me
And still you curse the day I decided to stay true to myself

It's so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
Than to burn in the spotlight  open fire  turn in the spitfire  open fire
Scream without making a sound  open fire  be up here without looking down  open fire
Oh afraid of heights

I remember the days when I was so eager to satisfy you
And be less then I was just to prove I could walk beside you
Now that I've flown away I see you've chosen to stay behind me

Swishing through the rye grass
With thoughts of mouse and apple pie
Tail balancing at half-mast

And the mouse police never sleeps
Lying in the cherry tree
Savage bed foot warmer
Of purest feline ancestry

Look out  little furry folk
He's the all night working cat
Eats but one in every ten
Leaves the others on the mat

And the mouse police never sleeps
Waiting by the cellar door
Window-box town crier
Birth and death registrar

With claws that rake a furrow red
Licensed to mutilate
From warm milk on a lazy day
To dawn patrol on hungry hate

No  the mouse police never sleeps
Climbing on the ivy
Windy roof top weathercock
Warm blooded night on a cold tile

The mouse police never sleeps

1677,"Slow mine feet are 
Frozen their veins.
Still closing helplessly afar 
Waking the creatures within.

I am a lonely traveller 
Awaiting to sleep eternally.
Under those cold woods 
As my fall brings them.

Shadows of their wings 
As howling their pleeds.
Wounded  I lay on ground
Listening their needs

It's dark and cold
And they fly slowly
The way they were told.
To feast mine fleshly dreaming.
And they know surely 
They raped mine soul.

Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see my dear is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around  comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around  comes back around you know
One thing that is clear it's all down hill from here

My love in your hand cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone  crumble in the light

Most of what you see my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around  comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of want to show
Because not everything that goes around  comes back around you know

And other nights she's just hanging with the stars.  And I've seen her waiting from all her mistakes And what if he never comes when you call?  And  ""Hey  hey it's alright "" she says  ""Once upon a time I lived a perfect night. Hey  hey in another life "" she says  ""In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago.""  ""Don't look back "" I heard a voice  in velvet I couldn't see. The pictures then were black and white  and the details were in between. I heard about a woman once  who did everything ever asked of her. She died last week and her last words were  ""It wasn't worth it.""  And I've seen her patience through all her mistakes And who's gonna save you now?  And  ""Hey  hey it's alright "" she says  ""Once upon a time I lived a perfect night. Hey  hey in another life "" she says  ""In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago.""  ""Hey  it's alright "" she says  ""Once upon a time I lived a perfect night. Hey  hey in another life "" she says  ""In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago.""  ""Hey  hey it's alright "" she says. ""Hey  in another life "" she says.  Way back when  when we became friends  I was you  you were my defense. And quiet was the night. You showed me that bridge  and it brought you home. You told me about it and I never let it go  And I guess I might've been doing the same. Anyhow  quiet was the night.","1,000 Years",2014,Hip Hop

And feel you come for me
Care free  she's got something big to tell me
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
There's no simple way
To let you know
Funny how she always cried out daddy
I got a big surprise  she said
I'm in trouble now
and it cannot wait
She's ten days late
Boy  your life got complicated
Well I can't wait
To see this through
She's ten days late

Low ride bicycles go cruising by
I laugh
I don't even know why
Talk back at the ocean
Consequence and ozone
Catch a glow
Oh no  baby  oh no no
Give me a minute now
To figure out my state
Oh I know
She's ten days late
And I don't know
Where to take it
But it's still great
Knowing you
She's ten days late
Ten days late
Time has come for you to choose
Baby daddies keep your boo
Many blessings come to you
Baby daddy keep your boo
Your eyes look to me for what to do
I can't lie
I don't know
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
No one's laughing
Now what do I say
I walk away but  oh no
Don't go
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
Give me a minute now
To figure out my state
She's ten days late
And I'm never going to fade it
I guess I'll always be

Knowing you

To Determine and direct the lives of family men who bear the burden Of living up to standard that doesn't exist in 1999  [Chorus]  Who's gonna save us from this lonely picket line  10 years of service but I'm still not worth your time. And I've seen men give their lives  And heard the stories that they tell of how they labored For this company which sold it's soul to hell  Times may be changing but I'll never leave behind the hopes And thoughts I have of better days for families such as mine. Because if history repeats itself and time will surely tell. What goes around will come around and you'll know our pain too well.  [Chorus],10 Years of Service,1999,Hip Hop
1744,"Listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there  not like you

Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy  spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice  these hypocrites won't see

But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one
Who illuminated your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine  a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely
On your way your way home

Oh  what are they going to do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way  but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray  Heaven knows when to lift you out
10  000 days in the fire is long enough  you're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates saying  ""I've come home now
Fetch me the spirit  the son  and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended  it's time now
My time now  give me my  give me my wings""

You are the light and way that they will only read about

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
(With the)
Burden of proof tossed upon the believers
You were my witness  my eyes  my evidence
Judith Marie  unconditional one

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion but
Should you see your Maker's face tonight
Look Him in the eye  look Him in the eye and tell Him
""I never lived a lie  never took a life but surely saved one
Hallelujah  it's time for You to bring me home""

Don Fredo on the phone line  he's tryin' to make a deal
Just another fresh disciple learnin' how to kneel

When I give him what he wants  then baby don't he squeal
Got a thousand fresh disciples I've never yet revealed

Kick!

1799,Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York My baseball mitt collects dust on the floor of my car. And I sort of secretly hope he's not there to stay... But anyway... I hope Sam's a famous actor one day...  Sometimes I dream I'm driving across the water In a car with my dad or my brother... Sometimes you dream you're in a foreign country And you packed all the wrong clothes...  Cars up on the overpass Fake the sound of waves I can feel the building shaking Pacing pacing pacing pacing  By the bedroom window Spying dirty eating urban birds... Picking myself apart Waiting for you to get home from work...  Since Sam Rosen packed up for New York I don't know what to do with do-nothing days I suppose there's no such thing anymore anyway... I suppose that's okay...  Cars up on the overpass Fake the sound of waves I can feel the building shaking Pacing pacing pacing pacing,10th Avenue Freakout,2005,Hip Hop

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses  leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle  watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though  there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

I'll be back for all y'all...",12,1995,Hip Hop

1831,"Hey  Merry Christmas  Adam! Merry Christmas  Fred!
Merry Christmas to everyone
Yeah man
You having a good year?
Yeah  it just feels good to be next to you here on the holidays
Hearing you say merry Christmas
It just warms my heart  man
It's like soul food  like fired okra
Dude  I'm having a great holiday this year  it's awesome
Yeah man  so you wanna sing for these people or what?
Yeah  here we go  okay

On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree
I don't even know what a partridge is  to be honest
A partridge is a bird
I think it's a bird that doesn't fly
Like Danny Bonaduce?
Um  no  it's
He's ripped  ripped I'm telling you
I heard he's a little  you know  fallen on the deep end  maybe
Oh  yeah  well
He's gonna kick my ass now
No  it's against that napoleon complex  he's short

So  on the  on the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
Turtle doves?
They're nice  do they have shells?
Uh  I don't know

But  on the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
From now on can you sing
""And a Danny Bonaduce""?

On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce
That's good! Yeah  yeah  it works  the syllables

Yeah  so I started to wonder
If my true love  my old lady
Was going to get me anything
Other than a bunch of birds
Yeah  they're all  like  pooping everywhere and stuff  it's gross
They're hard to clean up after
So far she got me four calling birds 
French hens  turtle doves
The French hens  which are the French hens
They're eating all your cheese
Drinking up all your wine
Like all hours of the day
I love France
So  I was wondering when
She was going to get me something good

And on the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings
Nice!
Yeah  I was finally happy
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a par-Danny Bonaduce

So  like  with the five golden rings
That's kinda nice
Yeah  but on the sixth day  she started getting-
Like Lil Wayne
Or what's another rapper
That has like a bunch of silly jewelry?
Um  I don't know any  man

But  on the sixth day
It kinda went downhill
And the seventh cause she got me
Six geese a-laying
Geese a-laying?
Like laying down?
No  like  geese that are laying
Like  oh  like
That's gross  yeah  I don't know about that
And then on the seventh day-
I often wonder how geese would go about doing that
If you're picking up what I'm putting down
I-I don't want to talk about it  man  okay

On the seventh day?
Seventh day
Seven swans swimming
More birds!
Swimming?
I hate it

On the eight day it got really weird
Cause on the eight day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eight maids a-milking
What?! Yeah!
What  are they milking the geese cause they're laying?
I think they're like lactating or something
I don't get that  yeah
I'm not into it

But  on the ninth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Nine ladies dancing
Nice! Okay  cool
Oh  well that explains the maids a-milking
No  these were like exotic dancers
Like you can see on the internet
Yeah  it was nice
There was like one of those poles and all that stuff
Yeah  but this is your old lady
That's getting you all these things  that's kinda weird
I know  but she's looking out for me  you know
Tenth day  tenth day  okay

On the tenth day it got crazy again
Cause she gave me ten lords a -leaping
Like the dark lords?
I don't know
That's so weird  and then the eleventh day
Pipers piping
Pipers piping?
These are  by far  the strangest gifts I have ever received
I don't understand-
Wait  like  laying pipe?
No  that's the geese that are laying pipe
Oh  well maybe they're laying it with the pipers
Which would be weird all together

But  on the twelfth day of Christmas
This is the last day
My true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Everybody could use a good drummer
Yeah  I could use twelve drummers  yeah
The Grateful Dead had two drummers
Dude  Slipknot has like ten  yeah
Did you get to  like  choose which drummers
Or are they just studio guys?
I think they were pretty bad ass
Oh  cool
I mean  not that Mark's not
I mean  Mark's kicking some ass  yeah
You know
Was he one of the twelve?
Um  I don't know  but

So  let's go down the list
And finish this godforsaken song off
Oh  okay and wish everyone a very merry Christmas

Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Let's give it up for the ladies dancing
Go ladies! Okay
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce

When all the stars align reveling all the answers that we seek

Does it fix anything? Can you tell me?

To draw my thoughts  I'll gather and tell
Like bricks that I've laid to build my life
Those that crumbled only caused me strife

Thoughts became words  cast into the sea
But they returned  always haunting me
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore
I just don't think I can give anymore

Because I've lived  how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived  how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything  you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger  music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind  the thoughts are too real

Because I've lived  how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived  how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything  you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out  I can't jump out
Too much to face  I can't erase

Because I've lived  how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived  how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything  you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out  I can't jump out
Too much to face  I can't erase

1841,"When nobody knows she puts on secret clothes
And lies in the meadow with her hands tied behind her back
I won't refuse if you know how to use it
Just stop playing that ugly drug music

And everyone's a prisoner of
Paper and glue
And a decent pair of scissors
So tonight I'm drinking to your health
Because I just can't stand myself

She stands and fails
On fashion fingernails
Her lovers have her walking 'round
On instruments of torture
And one of them is poisonous
The other is a thief they say
So what one could give to her
The other cannot take away

When nobody knows she puts on secret clothes
And lies in her splendor for a picture opportunity
Cover up that bruise  put on patent leather shoes
Just stop playing that bad mood music baby

Left to be unwritten Like memories to unfold And I don't believe the truth It doesn't make me feel alive The truth's just overrated We've all got something to hide  'Cause lies make it so much fun So sing the praise of insincerity  Make this your last prayer As the dream becomes your worst nightmare  I'm not your savior or a saint No use praying for escape I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head Just another crying shame Life is such a deadly game Gone wrong  fire at will Put a bullet in his head  Pay me no more mind Have I really come undone? I left the world this evening Just to kill the sun And I've got no more to bleed All that's left will soon be gone Especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn  Well I bet you got a lot to say So have it your way and crucify me  Maybe is your your last prayer As the dream becomes your worst nightmare  I'm not your savior or a saint No use praying for escape I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head Just another crying shame Life is such a deadly game Gone wrong  fire at will Put a bullet in his head  Breathless kiss to end all this I fall  I say goodbye to all Close my eyes oh sweet demise A love that no one understands  And I don't believe in redemption And no one will be spared There's thirty-two ways you can die here tonight It's a f*cking family affair  I'm not your savior or a saint No use praying for escape I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head Just another crying shame Life is such a deadly game Gone wrong  fire at will Put a bullet in his head,13 Voices,2016,Hip Hop

1878,I plugged 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six And a black crow snuck through A hole in the sky So I spent all my buttons on an Old pack mule And I made me a ladder from A pawn shop marimba And I leaned it up against A dandelion tree  And I filled me a sachel Full of old pig corn And I beat me a billy From an old French horn And I kicked that mule To the top of the tree And I blew me a hole 'Bout the size of a kick drum And I cut me a switch From a long branch elbow  I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin' Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six Whittle you into kindlin' Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six  Well I slept in the holler Of a dry creek bed And I tore out the buckets From a red Corvette  tore out the buckets from a red Corvette Lionel and Dave and the butcher made three You got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree With the strings of a washburn Stretched like a clothes line You know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole  I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin' Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six Whittle you into kindlin' Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six  Now I hold him prisoner In a washburn jail That stapped on the back Of my old kick mule Strapped it on the back of my old kick mule I bang on the strings just To drive him crazy I strum it loud just to rattle his cage Strum it loud just to rattle his cage  I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin' Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six Whittle you into kindlin' Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six,16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought-Six,1988,Hip Hop

1881,I remember when we had a lot of things to do  Impressed by all the words we read  And the heroes that we knew.  Climb on your your dream  a dream of our own making  To find a place that we could later lose  To whatever time would bring.   We were seventeen and the cakeman was affecting you Moving you to greater things (in a lesser way)  You had to prove.  The clock struck summertime. You were going round in circles now.  Wishing you were seventeen. At twenty-one  it was a long time gone.  And now here you are. You're locked in your own excuse.  The circle's getting smaller every day.  You're busy planning the next fifty years.  So stay the way you are and keep your head down to the same old ground.  Just paint your picture boy until you find  A closed circle's better than an open line.   Yes stay the way you are. I got a circle that's the same as yours.  It may be bigger  but I've more to lose.  Who is the luckier man me or you?,17,1988,Hip Hop

1885,"Tengo tanto miedo de decirte como soy
Todo lo que quiero en una simple decisión
Puede ser que tú me eleves
Yo no sé si tú me quieres

Diecisiete veces fuera de tu habitación
En cada espejo voy viendo el reflejo de mi situación
Yo no sé si tú me entiendes
Pero sé quién eres y sé lo que quieres

Viajo fuera de control
Persiguiendo la salida
Y es que no tengo el valo para decirte adiós

Peligrosamente pierdo la respiración
Se mueve el tiempo en cada momento
Y no hay explicación

Aunque sé muy bien que duele
Yo regreso a verte
No quiero perderte

Viajo fuera de control
Persiguiendo la salida
Y es que no tengo el valor para decirte adiós

1900,"Lo nuestro duró
Lo que duran dos peces de hielo
En un güisqui on the rocks
En vez de fingir
O  estrellarme una copa de celos
Le dio por reír
De pronto me vi
Como un perro de nadie
Ladrando  a las puertas del cielo
Me dejó un neceser con agravios
La miel en los labios
Y escarcha en el pelo

Tenían razón
Mis amantes
En eso de que  antes
El malo era yo
Con una excepción
Esta vez
Yo quería quererla querer
Y ella no
Así que se fue
Me dejó el corazón
En los huesos
Y yo de rodillas

Desde el taxi
Y  haciendo un exceso
Me tiró dos besos
Uno por mejilla
Y regresé
A la maldición
Del cajón sin su ropa
A la perdición
De los bares de copas
A las cenicientas
De saldo y esquina

Y  por esas ventas
Del fino laina
Pagando las cuentas
De gente sin alma
Que pierde la calma
Con la cocaína
Volviéndome loco
Derrochando
La bolsa y la vida
La fui  poco a poco
Dando por perdida

Y eso que yo
Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías
Para no comprarla
Con bisutería
Ni ser el fantoche
Que va  en romería
Con la cofradía

Del santo reproche
Tanto la quería
Que  tardé  en aprender
A olvidarla  diecinueve días
Y quinientas noches
Dijo hola y adiós
Y  el portazo  sonó
Como un signo de interrogación
Sospecho que  así
Se vengaba  a través del olvido
Cupido de mi
No pido perdón

¿Para qué? Si me va a perdonar
Porque ya no le importa
Siempre tuvo la frente muy alta
La lengua muy larga
Y la falda muy corta
Me abandonó
Como se abandonan
Los zapatos viejos
Destrozó el cristal
De mis gafas de lejos
Sacó del espejo
Su vivo retrato

Y  fui  tan torero
Por los callejones
Del juego y el vino
Que  ayer  el portero
Me echó del casino
De torrelodones
Qué pena tan grande
Negaría el santo sacramento
En el mismo momento
Que ella me lo mande
Y eso que yo

Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías
Para no comprarla

Desolation angels  Served it up with Love.  Ignitin'[g strife] like every form of light   Then moved by bold design   Slid in that thing and it grew wings   In Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.   It was blood  shining in the Sun;  First: Freedom!  Speeding the American claim:  Freedom; Freedom; Freedom; Freedom!    China was the tempest; [And] Madness overflowed.  [The] Lama was a young man   And [he] watched his world in flames.  Taking Glory down by the edge of clouds;  It was a cryin'[g] shame.  Another lost horizon. Tibet the fallen star.  Wisdom and compassion Crushed  in the land of Shangri-La.  But in the land of the Impala  honey  well   We were lookin' fine   'cause we built that thing and it grew wings;  In Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.  'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings;  In Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.   It was the best of times  it's [was] the worst of times;  In 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959.

1923,"How 'bout a tear for the year of 1960 
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall 
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall 

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble 
That was brewing in the Asian way 
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A. 

In the city of the lost and found 
It's hard to get a break 
Hard to stop from getting turned around 
And make the same mistakes 

My reputation's on the line 
The final day of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso 
I practiced 61 minutes a day 
I could never reach the keys 
But it was all OK 

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother 
That could brighten up the darkest nights 
It's just another sign of love 
Whenever we would fight 

It's all the same twenty years ago 
As it is right now 
Like a tour at the closing show 
When I take my bow 

My reputation's on the line 
At the start of '79 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 
I've played this part so many times 
Since the end of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today

Down upon our knees  We had tasted holy wine  And no one could sway us In a life time.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love had lit a fire; We were the flame. Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Not a word. And no one had to say we were changed. Nothing else we lived through Would ever be same the same  Knowing the truth That we had gained.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love had lit a fire; We were the flame. Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Stay with me. Make it ever new  So time will not undo  As the years go by  How I need to see That's still me.  Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love.  Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love has lit a fire; I am the flame. Burning into the darkness  Shining out from inside us.  Purer than the sky  Behind the rain. Falling down all around us  Calling out from a boundless love. Love has lit a fire; I am the flame.

Time heals so I?m told  I could never be sold  I don?t forget

Here?s what I think about vacant space 
Without a grain of doubt it?s all I think about  it?s all in my mind

1970,"You've gone too far
I'm on my way
You can tell the concierge
To bring around my car
You've gone too far

You said too much
Things you shouldn't say
You can keep your violins
Your sins  your care  your touch
You said too much

Get off the ground now baby
Just shut your mouth and maybe
This can all be done
I won't tell anyone

You showed them all
Things they shouldn't see
You lost the sense
The permanence  the flair  the ball
You showed them all

Well now I know
You take everything
Your car  your cash
Your shoes  your flash
You so and so
Well now I know

And I even think it's funny
Don't say you're sorry  bunny
You can keep the wings
Just let me get my things

You go too far

Call it negativity you're just distortion
Blow it up out of proportion

Through everything remembered from a new perspective
When I'm over-thinking I am too selective
So many are so lonely from another time oh
How I felt you'll never know

Cause I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
Oh I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

All we wanna do who who who who
who who who who
But I'm through
But I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

Served an ultimatum on a silver platter
I was on a plate but it doesn't matter
You can cut the cord on me but I got plenty
And hindsight sees in twenty-twenty

I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
Oh I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you
I'm through
Thinking 'bout you

All we wanna do who who who who
who who who who
But I'm through
But I'm through
Thinking 'bout you",20/20,2015,Hip Hop

Did you stand too close to the fire?

And in a way I don't mind watching it get unkind  Stand where it shines  I can inspire myself just fine I'm in the sweetest way misled  growing my hair in bed Coffee or beer--These are a year's component thread And everything is in terms of next time  Twenty-five thousand more miles to the dateline Is it because I'm 24  not 25?,24,1990,Hip Hop
2093,"Been given 24 hours
To tie up loose ends
To make amends
His eyes said it all
I started to fall
And the silence deafened
Head spinning round
No time to sit down
Just wanted to
Run and run and run
Be careful they say
Don't wish life away 
Now I've one day

And I can't believe
How I've been wasting my time

In 24 hours they'll be
Laying flowers
On my life  it's over tonight
I'm not messing no I
Need your blessing
And your promise to live free
Please do it for me

Is there a heaven a hell
And will I come back
Who can tell
Now I can see
What matters to me
It's as clear as crystal
The places I've been
The people I've seen
Plans that I made
Start to fade
The sun's setting gold
Thought I would grow old 
It wasn't to be

And I can't believe
How I've been wasting my time

In 18 hours they'll be
Laying flowers
On my life  it's over tonight
I'm not messing no I
Need your blessing
And your promise to live free
Please do it for me

In 13 hours they'll be
Laying flowers
On my life  it's over tonight
I'm not messing no I

All that I said  I meant it  I meant it

And I can't believe
How much I've wasted my time

Why I can't come to bed
I'm listening to the music
That's playing in my head
While your filled
With sleepy dreams
I'm moving to the sounds
The beat keep driving
In my brain
And the words go
Round and round
I see myself up on the stage
And holding my guitar
And I can't tell
If it's Carnegie Hall
Or just some local bar
But the hands are clapping
And the place is moving
And I feel it in my soul
It's late at night
And I can't sleep
I gotta write some
Rock and roll

It drives me crazy about
Twenty-four hours a day
It's bouncing all around
In my brain
I've just got to play

While the world
Outside is quiet
And the children
Are fast asleep
But here inside
I'm rockin' 'n' rollin'
To a crazy beat
So come on come on come on
Come on boys let's play
Yeah we're gonna do it 
Do it  do it

The bus is done but the taxis wait
Should we go down to Second Street?
Or just stay here 'cause that scene's beat?

Something that you don't

She is the girl and I really want to make her mine
I'm searching everywhere to find her again
To tell her I love her
And I'm sorry 'bout the things I've done

The only place in town where I didn't search
She looks so happy in her wedding dress
But she's crying while she's saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are

Against the wind I'm going home again
Wishing me back to time when we were more than friends
But I still see her in front of the church

She looked so happy in her wedding dress
But she's cried while she was saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Out in the streets
Places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat
Inside my head still I can hear the words she said

And when the going gets tough
I got a hole in the wall

2156,"I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning
""How and why""?

I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!

I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same

We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!

No hope in sight

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
And to justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time

The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie

I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!

Now I am terrified
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives

And why?
Can't anybody see through their disguise?
Only believe we didn't take their lives
And now the three of us have lost our lives

I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?

You can cry  forever  but you'll get no sympathy This is the best day of my life  [Repeat: x2] I've got 3 chains o' gold And they will shine forever They are the nucleus of my soul Melt down  no  they will never  Give back the chains  if you don't you will die Nothing should come between you and I  I've got 3 chains o' gold And they will shine forever If one of us has to go You will go before me  If one of us has to go (3 chains o' gold) You will go before me (3 chains o' gold) You will go before me  baby (they will shine forever) Cause I sho 'nuff say you will  (3 chains o' gold) (you will go before me) (you will go before me) (you will go before me) (u will go before me)  I've got 3 chains o' gold They gonna shine  Forever  forever  forever  (3 chains o' gold),3 Chains O' Gold,1992,Hip Hop

Never say forever cause forever's a lie
I can see right through it so I can't ignore you
The story changes but the ending will bore you

I tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
They didn't listen so they threw you away

Now all you do is talk 
I don't wanna hear your bullshit
Is this what you want?

This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation 
They told us that we wouldn't survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we're all plenty alive
We know where you are and were coming
Lets see you say that shit to our face

Thirty-one fifty remembers thirty
Thirty-one fifty hates

In my own peculiar way I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where but I still don't know the when

You wanna live in a one sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now with the grand facade
I don't want to be an angel
I just want to be God

They called us a dead generation 
They told us that we wouldn't survive

Memory's a memory until it's a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold!

Saw a lot of people die in the end
I never want to walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don't want to have it all 
I just want to have enough

This is where it begins
This is where it ends
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They told us that we wouldn't survive

2236,"Emmène-moi revoir une dernière fois
Ces endroits qui faisaient taire le vacarme
De mes idées noires

Les sommets qui jouent les mâchoires
Et ta cage thoracique se resserre
Quand tu les regardes de haut en bas

Emmène-moi revoir juste pour un soir
Le vert fluo des rizières
Qui triomphèrent de ma colère
Et consolèrent mon désespoir

Emmène-moi revoir une dernière fois
Ces choses qui faisaient sauter
Mes pensées périmées

La poussière orange des sentiers
Le béton brûlant de Miami
Et puis aussi les gens
Qui dansent à Tivoli

La jungle urbaine de Port Royal
Sniper Alley et ses tramways
Qui domptaient ma part animale
Au mois d'avril et au mois de mai

Il faut vraiment qu'on reparte le plus vite possible
Parce que tu sais que là
Ça devient carrément insupportable

Il faut qu'on se noie encore une fois
Dans les nuits fauves
Et les grands soirs
Qu'on récupère un peu d'espoir

Qui me rendaient 100 fois meilleur",4.000 Îles,2013,Hip Hop

Forty to one

So silent before the storm
Awaiting command
A few has been chosen to stand
As one outnumbered by far
The orders from high command
Fight back  hold your ground!

In early September it came
A war unknown to the world
No army may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone
Undone!

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

The 8th of September it starts
The rage of the Reich
A barrage of mortars and guns
Stand past  the bunkers will hold
The captain has pledged his life
I'll face my fate here!
The sound of artillery strike
So fierce
The thunder of guns

So come  bring on all that you've got
Come hell  come high water  never stop
Unless you are forty to one
Your lives will soon be undone
Undone!

Baptised in fire
40 to 1
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

Always remember  a fallen soldier
Always remember  fathers and sons at war
Always remember  a fallen soldier
Always remember  fathers and sons at war
Always remember  a fallen soldier
Always remember  buried in history

No vermin may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone
Undone!

I've loved you all along

We ignore because
We're all dumb and jaded

2322,"When she said  ""Don't waste your words  they're just lies ""
I cried she was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes 
Then said  ""What else you got left?""
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said  ""Don't forget 
Everybody must give something back
For something they get.""

I stood there and hummed 
I tapped on her drum
I asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot 
And straightened her suit 
Then she said  ""Don't get cute.""
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs 
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

She threw me outside 
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt 
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway  she went to get it 
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come  I asked her for some.
She said  ""No  dear.""
I said  ""Your words aren't clear 
You'd better spit out your gum.""
She screamed till her face got so red 
Then she fell on the floor 
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And you  you took me in 
You loved me then  you never wasted time.
And I  I never took much 
I never asked for your crutch
And I don't ask for mine.",4th Time Around,1994,Hip Hop

Before I woke to face the day  your master plan transpired.
Something told me  this job had more to meet the eye.
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole.

You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom

Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.
You cry for compensation.
I ask you please just give us

5 minutes alone

I read your eyes  your mind was made up.
You took me for
A fool.
You used complexion of my skin for a counter
Rascist tool.
You can't burn me  I've spilled my guts out
In the past.
Taken advantage of because you know where

I've come (from) my past.
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom

Can't be what your idols are.
Can't leave the scar.

And in wheelchairs by monuments
Under tube trains and commuter accidents
In council care and county courts

In transit camps  under arc lamps
On unloading ramps
In faces blurred by rubber stamps

Upon this hill
I plundered from the pool
I look around
I search the skies
I shade my eyes
So nearly blind
And I see signs of half remembered days
I hear bells that chime in strange familiar ways
I recognise...
The hope you kindle in your eyes

It's oh so easy now

Nothing interferes  it's obvious
How to beat the tears
That threaten to snuff out

2356,Another obituary in the paper today One more for the list of those who've already fallen Another one of our comrades is taken down Like so many others of our calling  We tweet our anecdotes  our commentary Or we sing his songs in some sad tribute While the tabloids are holding a story of kiss and tell That he's no longer able to deny or refute  50 000 voices rising every time he'd sing And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him  How well I remember the stadiums we played And the lights sweeping across a sea of 50 000 souls we'd face A serious drug that you could never kick Or one that you couldn't imagine you'd ever replace  We flew like kites on the wings of amphetamine Secured only to a bass line and a snare drum beat But really what did any of it mean? When there's a higher philosophy in reflection and defeat  50 000 voices rising every time he'd sing And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him Still believing that old lie  the one that your own face betrays Rock stars don't ever die  they only fade away  Reflecting now on my own past Inside this prison I've made of myself I'm feeling a little better today Although the bathroom mirror is telling me something else  These lines of stress  one bloodshot eye The unhealthy pallor of a troubled ghost Where did I put my spectacle case? I'm half blind and as deaf as any post  50 000 hands are raised to a man that's just like you and me We create the gods we can and gift them immortality Still believing that old lie  the one that your own face betrays Rock stars don't ever die  they only fade away,"50,000",2016,Hip Hop

Just be quiet and feel it around you

And I opened my heart to the whole universe

I just gotta bring it to they attention dirty  that's all

You better watch who you talkin bout  runnin your mouth  like you know me
You gon' f*ck around and show why the ""Show Me"" get called the ""Show Me""
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France  but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats  total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compare this  my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola  no service  out of your range
You out of your brains  thinkin' I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss  still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin' and cryin suck it up as a loss
'Cause your  acts is wack  your whole label is wack
And matter fact  eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I am  number one  no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey
I  am  number one ey ey  ey ey
Now let me ask you man
What does it take to be  number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (ey)
What does it take to be  number one?
Ey ey  ey ey

Do you like it when I shake it for ya  daddy?
Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?

Hell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn
Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say  she say  did he say
What I think he said? Squash that  he probably got that off eBay
Or some  Internet access some  website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine  don't wind up on the flat line
Oh if my uncle could see me know
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties  comin' askin  ""Yo where the party?""
Oh lordy  will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi  got me thinkin fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know  PIMP

I am  number one  no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey

Half the time you be them niggas who f*ckin album flop

C'mon! Mad 'cause I'm hot  he just  mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props  just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks  and keep my fans comin' in flocks
'Til you top the Superbowl  keep your mouth on lock
Shh
I'm awake
I'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin' for granted blessin' e'rything on my life
Tryin' to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak the truth
I heat the booth  Nelly actin' so uncouth (so crazy)
Top down shirt off in the coupe  spreadin' the loot
With my family and friends  and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win dirty  dity

It's the  Boss Hog  known Big Dawg
The boss of the ghetto and I ball like a Dawg
You see that  four pound  ga-round  and round
round banana clip and I shut your hood down
See I floss like Jewelry (stay broke like Woodie)
It's the number 1 daddy  look for carpet and pully
See I shine like feet  23's for me
24's on the truck and leave on dub streets
See I wipe a bitch down
Then dribble on the hoe
And touch her from her head  from her waist to her toe
Now buckle up Ma it's time to ride out
G-waggin' daddy   I keeps it down south
Escalade truck  in the back  and it's nasty
Cut it on the side  switch it out  and it's a Caddy

Chorus(2x)

Verse 2: (Mannie Fresh)
Let me holla at these niggas that went out bad
They jumped in the magazine and showed they ass
But it ain't nothin' but stunna to bust a nigga ass
When I jumped off the porch  y'all were still on the grass (Biotch)
Nigga gave me a shot and gave me a gun
Fresh loaded the gun and told me have some fun
But A A- the be	-I the I-I

The swine  the mink  let's get it together
The prowler  the swade  the jacket  the leather
Headliner  rebot  tailor made sweaters
The guns  the pistol  automatic niggas
Ak  nine glocks   mackin' left niggas

You betta understand because these hoes all minors (You better Biotch!)

Verse 3 :
I went from  teach to streets  to solvin' this beef
Nigga gave me my shot   November the nuts ski
Aye aye 19 that is (Woooo)
See them tattoo tears
See I'm a known deep boy with the dope in the frig
It's me Lac and Stone and all my kids
Ridin' round town in that brand new Jig (Woooooo Weeeee!)
Jaguar that is
See I'm world wide grindin' and I'm tryin' to live
You know how it is when you  got the kids
You gots to go home and get it how you live
Ain't got no money so you pick at eye lids
Turn around the corner and you askin' why
You fought everybody cause you stupid ass high
Asked mom for money you dumb motherf*cka (f*cka)

Type of nigga to get drunk and piss in your cup
Listen up to what it is  know a lotta mamis lovin' the triz
And some  they tryin' to pull it off right in front of the kids
Before I think about coming to cribs  I be lugging my glitz so big
On the waist it be rubbing my ribs  it's very dangerous f*ckin' with this

I been doublin' chips holdin' my own with the chrome double-grips
Up in the mix  caught a couple of vics when I used to fight
But I ain't been scufflin' since this is as tough as it gets
Never leave nothin' with prints or you get blast
And you're chopped up and stuffed in the fridge
They not playin' me  I perfected this game from A to Z

I have a nigga in his home hopin' I don't blow his dome open
I stay stoned  smokin' while I'm on the low  I'm copin'

A cool guy  but at times you catch me Tone-Locin'
Been through a lotta shit  but never had a bone broken
It's tragic how I rap shit with my own potion
From here to Hoboken I was hoppin' trains with no token
Now I'm on stage  they say I'm show-boatin' my flow potent

Woo  yeah  aha  aha  you know
Yeah  word up

Come on  lights  cameras  action it's on
Straight outta gate with another hot song
Keepin' it real though gonna last long
Break out the stiletto coming mad strong

Bounce if you wanna  lounge will play the corner
I'm New York talking that gangster talk
Twenty-four bases  queue to the oasis
Suspicious see eyes and no faces

Been there  years just put in to work
For the dough  so you know that I couldn't get jerked
Street mental  throw on the hoodie then lurk
In the rental until the end of the earth

I'ma be that fellow with the mozzarella
Always cooking up the new hot seller
Putting that money in the bank like the teller
And this be the number one rank  let me tell you

It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time

On the fast track chilling  creeping like a villain
In 2000 new car  new house and
Buy the whole store up  style I'm too pro  son
Get even more buck wild  I draw crowds and

In every state I still draw them at every forum
Don't lose no points I just score them
And count blessings at the top of my freshness
Live  get it right this is not no job

Today or tomorrow it doesn't matter
Got the stages moving on up the ladder
And stay grounded  remember the Bronx 'cause they founded
Cutting them old joints up by James Brown  kid

Golden  'fore I forget hold it
Got to shout out the block  four-fifth Holden
And Jamaica  Queens I'm true to the fort
Every day  all day not new to the sport

In Elisabeth  kids in Queens is who I feast with
When I ain't in the lab flipping beats with
Drums to pound  I be breaking it down
With homeboy Van on the way uptown  how that sound

It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time
It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time

There's a whole lot of rappers in the world today
Some good  there is some that got nothing to say
Some fake  some false  some imitation
But I'm the uncut raw for your generation

Work magic with terms like never before
Hang them rappers live  leave their head on the floor
Drop hits for the hip hop crowd that rock kicks and hats
Crisped jeans and whips to match

Hardcore system up on blast
Cock  dip and stash live now and forget the past
In the streets try to hustle while eating a meal
Watching out so you don't get beaten in the grill

'Cause the crossroads is deep  sleep and you will
Be the next one up  I'm feeding the real
So get eardrums son  start heating the drill
One time and this is what y'all feel and I'ma still be

2435,[B-Real talking] A lot of a  sharks out there  try'na take a bite of somethin' What's hot Lot of chameleons out there  try'na change up Anytime somethin' new comes along  everybody wants a bite Don't happen overnight  [Chorus] So you want to be a rock superstar?  And live large  A big house. Five cars  You're in charge.  Comin' up in the world.  Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly  I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up Looking in the mirror  dreaming about blowin' up  The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys.  Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me. Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest  And the games that be comin' with it  Nevertheless  you got to go for the gusto  But you don't know about the blood  sweat  and tears and  Losin' some of your peers.  And losin' some of yourself to the years past  gone by  Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy  Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act  Shit's deep  48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal  Think he's gonna make a mil but never will  'Til he crosses over  still  Fillin' your head with fantasies  Come with me  Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's   You want to be a rock superstar in the biz  And take shit from people who don't know what it is  I wish it was all fun and games  But the price of fame is high  And some can't pay the way  Feel trapped in What you rappin' about?  Tell me what happened when you lost clout?  The route you took started collapsing  No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and Everybody shits on your name.   [Chorus: x2]  People see rock stars  you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out  More like everybody else  you know  its a fun job  but its still a job. There's  Gonna be another cat comin' out  Looking like me  sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside  Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.  You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream?  Big shot  heavy hitter on the mainstream  You want to look trendy in the Bentley  Be a star band  never act friendly.  You want to have big fame  Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains  First they get played like all damn day  Long as you sell everything will be ok  Then you get dissed by the media and fans  Things never stay the same way they began  I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest  That's why fools end up dining on a bullet  Think everything's fine in the big time  See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine  So you roll far and live large  It ain't all that goes with being a rock star  [Chorus: x2]  My own son don't know me  I'm chillin' in a hotel room  lonely  But I thank God I'm with my homies  But sometimes I wish I was back home  But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love  They're phony  Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony  I'm in the middle like Monie  And the press say that my own people disown me  The best way back to keep your head straight  Never inflate the cranium  They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium  Who just want to cling on  swing on  and so on  Go on fall off - the ho's fall off  To the next rock superstar with no shame  Give him a year and they'll be right out the game  The same as the last one who came before him  Gained fame started getting' ignored  I warned him  Asured him this ain't easy  Take it from the weazy  Sleazy people want to be so cheesy  They're f*cking evil  Assassins  assassins  [Chorus: x2],(Rock) Superstar,2000,Hip Hop

I'm just tryna shed a little light It can be hard It can be so hard But you gotta live right now You got everything to give right now  I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine Who can relate? I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine  I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive) I finally wanna be alive I don't wanna die today (hey) I don't wanna die I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive) I finally wanna be alive (oh) I don't wanna die (no  I don't wanna die) I don't wanna die (I just wanna live) (I just wanna live)  Pain don't hurt the same  I know The lane I travel feels alone But I'm moving 'til my legs give out And I see my tears melt in the snow But I don't wanna cry I don't wanna cry anymore I wanna feel alive I don't even wanna die anymore Oh I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't even wanna die anymore,1-800-273-8255,2017,Hip Hop

I look up
Finally Famous nigga

I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10  then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

All this bread can't be good for my cholesterol
Don't come round' talking loudly  f*cking up my repertoire dawg
I can't lie bruh lately I've been stressing heavily
I'm sipping  popping  smoking on whatever take the pressure off
Diss you  FF Imperial 'til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti f*ck boy material 'til I'm dead  I'm living proof
If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral
It's gone  word  boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I'm bringing home dead prez  my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back  right along with my garments
Went to sleep  snoring

I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10  then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook  one clean  the other PMS'ing  no hable ingles
If police have questions they don't know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon' pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil 'cause thought the fair was here
Like oh  I'm primo  top spot redeemed ho  for who  my team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica  Montego  pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the f*ck I need to sleep for?

Bitch  I do what I do  I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rise  got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her  for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill  but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase  every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
Good music or die ho  shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes  shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than day-day  no off day just pay day
Boy  since I was a bae-bae I swear was OG  you was a no G
Texting these hoes that you love 'em and shit  prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG  bitch  I'd still be more G
F*ck you know about night terrors  nightmares and night scares
About not getting that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped control just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed  yep  changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearing the same clothes
Going to the same club  taking the same pose
Pillow talking with the same hoes
All day about how find 'em and Hov hit the same hoes
Some niggas never grew up until they grew old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
F*ck with me and you'll destroy fool
End up on the f*cking Detroit news  better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters  I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm  Caesar had Brutus
F*ck am I saying  Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright thought if I just got you  bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend  I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek  me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10

My new bitch is Hispanic  got me speaking bi-language
Some call it tricking cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherf*cking die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you f*cked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Coming through and I don't f*ck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna f*ck a nigga
Good chance she done f*cked a nigga
Turned around and said f*ck that nigga
Stack on my belt  double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control  so nigga f*ck what you thought

I've been held from ten to tens  swear I won't sin again
Bring the Hell to my residence  godly presence with presidents
My day job  it made me shit  public housing ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense  niggas whole home invaded quick
I did work  I done pay my dues  I'm induced  now I'm overdue
One hit one  call this voodoo  don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain  one problem  plus the issues  I can't solve them
But it's nothin'  and I'm still in the club on the couch still f*ckin' up somethin'
Nigga please! Mama please  I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred  shit
Scratch that  'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write
Did songs with Hov  now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn  how you do that?

I gave you three situations
And ten ways to deal with it

Ballin'
Or playin' on broads
You  too  can be scraped
I said scraped - that's right - scraped
See what I'm sayin'
And these (?)
I mean  we gotta get together - marry yourself  man
'cause ain't nobody gon' care 'bout yourself but yourself
Know what I'm sayin'
Go marry yourself  go on a honeymoon - treat yourself
I mean  'cause can't nobody cheat on theyself
You gon' be with yourself  but you can't cheat on yourself
You know what I'm sayin'
Man  that's ballerrific
Stuntastic

Yo  yo  yo   My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans  Because I recognize its all about timin'  Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science  In front of 20 ft. bonfires lookin' skyward   Calculating May 5  2000 the nine planets'll be in alignment  The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit  Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet  With mercury ion rockets   And a big ass ""Canibus comin soon"" poster on the side of it  I'm known geographically and intergalactically  That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me  They even tried kidnappin' me   And they would've snatched me  If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity  Engines stalled and failed. Crashed into a farmer's field  And that's really what caused Roswell   Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12  Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal  Lyrically I'm off scale  So all hail or get tossed towards Hell  whatever y'all feel   Briusin' niggas  confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens  Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles  Hear the wild wolf growl  Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds   Wack niggas want to be down but its not allowed  Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth  With the southpaw southern fist  I'll bust your shit. Swell your lip and get the Bubba shrimp   Back the tougher shit. What a wimp  You giant Goliath. Niggas get shot with a rubber sling  I'm an experiment gone bad.  My brainwave's on an ????? graph. Yo  I'm stark ravin mad   Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast  When I throw the ????? flask in my hand  Flammable liquids in the lab explode  And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass   Trained to blow up commercial aircrafts  Trained in chemical weapons class  Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last  I put him in a leather mask   Spray his ass with a can of ???? gas  Then watch him grab his neck and gag  Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh  ""You want to battle?"" is the type of question you should never ask   Nigga  pick a tougher task. See who the f*ck'll last  Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass  You need to recognize  My hand is quicker than the eye   Quicker than the 5 speed Jamiroquai drives  A lifespan longer than 9 lives. Infinite rhymes that can't die  A nigga with a divine mind  I dedicate this to the wise. Dedicate it to dames   Dividin' myself into 100 ten times  You can't deny the offering's an offer  Flows that glow with aurora's the spark of light  Water fly like a saucer  With the torque of a Porsche  Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins  Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'm a live long   And I'm a be gettin' it on till I'm gone  Look at all the stages I been on. All the songs that I spit on  I took an oath to rip everything I get on  A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndromes   In the wristbones from grippin' microphones this long  I'm just a small fish in a big pond  And gets pissed off whenever I gets picked on  Nigga try to flip and get flipped on   My army march a million strong  Like the nation of Islam with suede timbs on  Extremely hostile  Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles   A lyrical lynch mob  Shittin' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on  Duckin' down low like Vietnam fightin' the Vietcong  Screamin' ""incomin'"" when I see a bomb   Speak to your leader. Surrender your arms  You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds  Plus 800 000 to even consider a war  And 200 000 more to even look hard   You better drop your flag and withdraw  My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors  And smash y'all. Attach y'all to the back of my horse  And drag y'all across the motherf*ckin' asphalt   9 out of 10 niggas is frauds  You know who you are always talkin' about your bitches and your cars  Your jewelry and your girls. It's like we from two different worlds  You motherf*ckers really get on my nerves   'Cause I'm beyond them  on some futuristic cyborg shit  I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what picture crossed in  Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience  To barbecue your brain organs   You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven  I flame broil suckers and hit 'em with some more shit  The raw shit. Call my reinforcements  the four horsemen  Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit   I dare a motherf*cker to cross it  I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin  Tell him it's important. Tell him to call Sting 3 way and sing a   [Chorus]  Break your camcorders so you motherf*ckers can't record it  Call the news  I'll kill your reporters  Start a lawsuit  I'll kill your lawyers  F*ck the soft shit and f*ck what y'all think   My album's gold cause my album was the bomb  shit  Y'all niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it  Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid  'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys   You f*ck 'em in the ass  then you give 'em cash for it  That's some sick shit homeboy  A hundred years ago  they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud  You fraudulent. Feminine. Fragile as a feather is   With an effortless blow  I'll crack your whole skeleton  You think you're better than Canibus  where's the evidence?  You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship  You need to shut the f*ck up cause your breath stink   Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints  Battlin' me you never win  You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in?

We haven't spotted them yet But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity  A 100 miles and runnin Mc Ren  I hold the gun and You want me to kill a muther f**ker and it's done in. Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct - Is one of the main reasons I don't give a f**k. Chances are usually not good Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood. And getting' jacked by the you-know-who. When in a black and white the capacity is two. We're not alone  we're three more brothers  I mean street-brothers. Now wearin'  my dyes  'cause I'm not stupid  muther f**kers. They're out to take our heads  for what we said in the past. Point blank - they can kizz my black azz. I  didn't stutter when I said ""f**k tha police"". Cause it's hard for a nigga to  get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. Cause police and little black  niggas don't mix so  Now I'm creepin' Through the fall. Runnin' Like a team. Well  see  I might have slayed y'all. So  for now pack the gun and Hold it in the air. ?cause mc ren has a 100 miles of  runnin  ""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run."" ""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed"" ""100 miles to their home base  Compton.""  Lend me a muther f**kin' ear. So I can tell you why...  Runnin' With my brothers  headed for the home base. With a steady pace on the face that just we raced. The road ahead goes on and on. The shit is getting' longer than the muther f**kin' marathon. Runnin' on but  never runnin' out. Stayin' wired and if I get tired  I can still try out.  Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do. But nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta  attitude.  Confused. Yo  but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose. One of the few who's been  accused and abused Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. But you don't know  shit til you been in my shoes. And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some  shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that  disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard  hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for  havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the  FBI's all over my dick.  Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's  when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and  yo  it's a  long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah   back to Compton again. Yo  it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas  been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my  muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but   yo  I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough. Just like Carl  Lewis I'm bailin' the f**k out. from city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.  Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm A straight up nigga that's done  in  gunnin' and comin' Straight at yo ass. A 100 miles and runnin'  This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton. You're almost there  but the FBI has a little message for you: ""nowhere to run  to  baby. Nowhere to hide."" Good luck brothers.  Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose. Show me on the news but I hate to be abused. I know it was a set-up. So now I'm gonna get up. Even if the FBI wants me to shut up. But I've got 10 000 niggas strong. They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song. And while they treat my group like dirt  Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts. So I'mma run til I can't run no more. 'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score. I got a urge to kick down doors. At my grave like a slave even if the ren calls.  Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'. Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherf**ker's are ridin' Started with five and  yo  one couldn't take it. So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it. The number's even - now I'm leavin'. We're never getting' took by a bitch with a weave in. Her and the troops are right behind me. But they're so f**kin' stupid  they'll never find me.  One more mile to go through the dark streets. Runnin' like a mutherf**ker on my own two feet. But you know I never stumble or lag last. I'm almost home so I better haul ass. Tearin' up everything in sight. It's a little crazy mutherf**ker dodging the searchlight. Now that chase  the shit  is done and Four mutherf**kers goin' crazy with A 100 miles of runnin' Stop! stop! stop! stop!

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses  leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle  watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though  there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

I'll be back for all y'all...",12,1995,Hip Hop

Thugs wit me 'cus they know I roll wit Kells and dem

Then I spot mami shakin' like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a jelly bean
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
And I'm glad I brought my ass to the right party

Ooh  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all f*cked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts  ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no going home  the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body  it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Stack my chips  make dem hits and
I can tell that y'all love my shit
And got my shirt off  wit my Timbs on
Here all night so you know it's going on

Mami shake it like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a tangerine
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
Glad I brought my ass to the right party tonight

Ooh  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all f*cked up

Ain't no goin' home  the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body  it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

No more excuses  now in the two doors exclusive
And everything is all inclusive
We can do it all if my boys included
On da phone wit her friends invite 'em all  let's do this

Get things juicy  it's more than enough room in da jacuzzi
For you to lose the feeling of a groupie
Leave ya dude lose the feeling of a hoopty
New Kells playing feelin' on yo' booty

Keys to the Ferrar  leave in the garage
Starts wit a massage  ends wit ménage
Ends in me gettin' da skins to some DeBarge
Just 'cus she tellin' her friends it was garbage

Four a.m.  gotta a babe on the cell
Five a.m.  on my way to the tel
But then around six  same thing  different chick
XL mag  perfect fit  now to the bridge  let's go

Baby showin' me all these crazy things
Got me nibblin' on her belly ring
'Bout to get into the swing of things
She keep rubbin' againist my swinga thing

We off up in the other room so hot
Shorty's about to take off that pink tank top
All I wanna say is  shorty drop it like it's hot
(Drop it like it's hot  drop it like it's hot)

Ooh  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all f*cked up

Welcome female is in my arms.   Overwhelmed by my playboy charms  We jumped in the ride rushed to the crib  I ain't gotta explain what we did  Built to last I simply waxed that   Ax the question  no need for guessin'  Hey baby  how old are you?  21 24 maybe 22   I'm twenty five   She shucked and kinda neeghed   And said  ""hee  hee  hee I'm only 13""   13!!

(Man her brothers will beat you )   GOOD!!   (Even if I get beat down it was still)   GOOD!!   The story gets better  This girl is kinda clever   She said  ""I want to be with you forever""   I said  ""Forget it I need to get my life in order   You could almost be my daughter""   She started sighin' and her sighin' turns into cryin'   Her cryin' turns into her replyin'   ""Where's the phone?. I think it's time that I went home""   She called her pops and said  ""Come get me I'm all alone   I'm sorry daddy I slept with an older man""   He said  ""Don't worry. The 45 is in my hand.   I'll be there before you count to four.""   One two three four   He's at my door   She said  ""See what you did you caused me all this grief.   Your goin' to jail my daddy's a police chief.   If I can't have you no one will.   And I ain't even on the pill.""   But you was   Chorus: Repeat 6x   GOOD!!   Daddy walked in and the whole scene kinda changed   He grabbed his daughter and almost beat the girl insane   She's cryin' down the hall and now goin' home   He closed the door and  ""I'm happy we're all alone   Jump on the bed and look me straight into my eyes   I think your kinda cute  don't make me use my 45""   Daddy's lookin' for a lubricant   He pulled out a little piece of gum and started chemwin' it   He said  ""For year I've been lookin for a big strong man   I've got an apartment out in Brooklyn   Only my daughter and I live there   You can see my daughter anytime  anywhere   But it's you that I want to be mine   The price tag is your behind   Don't worry it'll be   Chorus:   GOOD!!

Naci un dia de junio
Del año 77
Planeta mercurio
Y el año de la serpiente
Sin o patente
Tatuado y en mi frente
Que en el vientre de mi madre
Marcaba el paso siguiente
Me hace llorar
Sin anestesia en la camilla
Mi padre solo dijo es Ana Maria
Si seria el primer llanto
Que me probaría
Quemando las heridas
Y dándome la batería
Solía ser entonces como un libro abierto
Pero leí la letra pequeña del texto
Como un arquitecto
Construyendo cada efecto
Correcto  incorrecto  sé aprender todo al respecto
Saber que algunas personas
Queran el daño
Subir peldaño
Toma tiempo toma año
Con mi peluche mirando lo cotidiano
Dibujos transformaban
Y el invierno en gran verano
Papa me regalo bajo mi insistenso
Juego  trataba de culparte y recibencia
Pero en el cartu hicieron la competencia
Y fue cuando senti mi primera impotencia

Todo lo que cambia lo hará diferente
En el año que nació la serpien

1977 no me digan no
Que uno lo presiente
Todo lo que cambia lo hará diferente
En el año que nació la serpien

Mi adolescencia
Fue una etapa bizarra
El cuerpo es batería
Y la cabeza guitarra
La orquesta narronato
Nada quebrada para la mirada
De una niña que solo talla espadas
Hormona disparada
Sobre poblada sin formas
En que cambian temporadas
Caminas en crucijadas
Cada cual es su morada
Preparaba la carnada
La sagrada diablada
De mirada encabronada
Mi fila la verdad
Nunca busco su silla
Mi búsqueda fue mero
Proceso de pura pila
Pupila de poeta
Que marco nuestra saliba
En la cordillera que miraba la salida
La parada militar de paso monótono
Colores policromolos
Uniformes de poco tono
Detono mi cuestionamento
La voz si sonó no
Mi primera rima que sonó
Y me enrrolo
Mi búsqueda no fue para mi cosa de escenario
Fue algo necesario
Que marcaba ya mi fallo
Así que todas
Mas de lo necesario
Fue cuando entendí
Que todos quieren ser corsario

I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life 'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife But then again I think I`ll spare ya 'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya See I`m the holder of the key  Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me  I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins  They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t Gonna make it and then end up a statistic My life was twisted I almost missed it The chance yes the chance to make you feel good I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me And the nation of Islam has my support  'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost And the 5 percent nation takes other steps To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps And in the prison they give the brothers new visions Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream Of a total different scene I dress clean  stand lean  Say what I mean and I`m out Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout  [Chorus]  For right now yo my religion is rhyming Perfect timing test the flow and climb in Ansaar  Sunnite  Sheite  Jihad All must regard the times are hard Unite or perish Is the message I cherish That goes for my people of all religions If we`re all black why have so many divisions Superficial factors are drawing us apart  Don`t let it happen Let`s put some respect back in So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one And I just might have one  Or two or maybe even three or four And plus an army of 100 or more But violence is never my first choice I come in peace to release the effect of my voice  [Chorus],2 Deep,1992,Hip Hop

2538,It's obvious  that you got it goin on And I'm contemplating I'm curious  it you mean what you say when you say it And if you're serious about what you want to do 'Cause I have to be honest with you I'm not into you Casanovas  telling me what I want to hear Just so they can get over And after they get what they want  they're done But I been there and done that But you don't really seem like that You're just so cool  and it just seems  [Chorus:] Too good to be true What you say what you do So I gotta be careful Don't want to fall too soon And if I come across sometimes being rude It's nothing against you It just seems  too good to be true  I'd love for us to keep doing things together But I don't want to rush the feeling (don't want to rush the feeling) We can take our time (our time) I really don't mind Besides I gotta know  what you waitin' for 'Cause I don't need no Casanova  telling me what I want to hear Just so you can get over And after you get what you want  you're done But I been there and done that But you don't really seem like that You're just so cool  and it just seems  [Chorus]  Tell me if we stay together In a month will you break it off?

As I'm rollin' down the block
A player gotta beep
That said ""I want to f*ck""
A two way freak
Her name is Rhonda Peary
Who works at the dairy
Her chewin' is da bomb
But her face looks scary
I'm pushin' down the street
Tryin' to make it to her house
And then I gotta beep from my freak named Minnie Mouse
They call her Minnie Mouse
She live a couple trees
She eat a lot of cheese
If you hit she'll squeak

Scrollin' threw my two way is like scrollin' threw my cash flow

It's goin' down
Not now but right now
By now you know the sound
It's dilation  cats with 20/20

I tell nickel and dimers try not to be dealers
If they deal at least help  try not to be villains
And if they caught dealin'  try not to be squealers
If they do try not to be shocked to see killers

Yeah  I'm crazy eyes killer  triple optic
Cold man go Guerrilla  pure with no filler
Rakaa's that real-I  bend steal at will
Eyes open  wide awake  y'all keep your eyes peeled

I never ratted  just rat-a-tat-tatted
Fully automatic  you're whole aura shattered
I got beats and rhymes  either or it never mattered
Flow fast or slow like I did on  ""Eyes Have It""

I don't waste days away glued to John Madden
So when the sun sets West  I ain't mad at it
I gravitate towards those cats who ain't dramatic
And seein' 20/20 money stacks is a habit

Yeah  hindsight is 20/20  let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20  a toast to the past
But here's to the future  20/20

Last couple years shit been off the wall
Many tears lost my mom I'm stayin' strong
Regroup myself  dust my shoulder off
We back once again then poof we gone

I seen shit go down like Alc' almost die
Now I see why they say it's safer to fly
In the same breath  breathe life accept death
Until then 20/20  one of the best yet

I've had experiences that were out of body
Cops still probably clocked me comin' out of parties
I've seen scandalous verdicts make Los Angeles uprise
Black Tail bottoms and Cannabis Cup highs

Create to Devestate taught me how to bomb
From Radiotron  to the German autobahn
Trade money still different color and shade bills
20/20 wide awake y'all keep your eyes peeled

It's goin' down
Not now but right now
By now you know the sound
It's dilation  cats with 20/20

Yeah  hindsight is 20/20  let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20  a toast to the past
But here's to the future  20/20

Three eyes wide  I can still see Ali
Say I float like a butterfly  sting like a bee
Now I float like a brother's high  swing like a beast
I'm from Mid-City  when the bell rings I'm released

Hustlin'  fightin' and eatin' still bringin' relief
To my people  if they're in your reach  each one teach
Runnin' through so much grass my shoes need cleats
Got that ""Vente Vente"" pumpin' through these streets

Last LP was odd  the score's even at last
Now we got enough trees to make you take 4 and pass
Now we got enough in fact don't even pass that back
It's free weed on me  you can hold me to that

When you see me in the streets  it be for that 20/20
Better than diesel  better than kush  it ain't funny
But trust me this Cali  my block's best product
We so quick to cop  Dilated Peoples got 'em

Yeah  hindsight is 20/20  let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20  a toast to the past

With the one-two  one-two shot to the chin

Before dog fightin' and aerial strikes

2574,21 Concepts  I wrote a song about a fetus named Cletus who tried To run for governor before he died He lived in California but traveled worldwide It was a big huge hit! Just kidding I lied There's the song about the 90's  I sampled Ace of Base But kept it off the album in the interest of taste “Cheyenne Rock City ” a song about touring But rhymes about Wyoming are really very boring As for the Churchill song  give me a break! How many songs about England could my listeners take? There was a track about women and the drama they bring “Hot Girls Make Guys Do Really Stupid Things” Remember “Geeked Out”? You don't but I do  “The geek shall inherit the Earth ” it's true! I rapped about nerds being cooler than jocks But if I wanted biased news  I would have just watched Fox  CHORUS I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb But when I laid them down in ProTools They all came out wrong!  “Las Vegas Invasion” was a sci-fi track About aliens addicted to playing blackjack I wrote a song about a kid who made his own flick But got a bad review in Ranger Rick I didn't want to get lynched or punched in mouth So I didn't do that song making fun of the South I did a song about how girls at Stanford are whack Called “College Is Where Girls Go to Get Fat” There was the KRS slash Nirvana debut But the mash-up thing was so 2002 I did an anti-Bush track  and then I did five more But “Rock Against Bush” was so 2004 I wrote a song about China  how could I go wrong? I rapped in Cantonese about Mao Zedong It went um goy  neh ho ma? Nehih sik ying mun ma?  CHORUS I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son I've got CD-R of tracks I once thought would be tight But when I played it for my girl I slept alone that night!  Write a song about a can that gets crushed a lot Write a dental hygiene jam that says  “brush a lot” Write a Bill O'Reilly track that says “hush” a lot No I'm not a player I like Rush a lot!  CHORUS I've got 21 concepts but a single ain't one “If you're still referencing Jay Z I feel bad for you son” So what's the secret to hip-hop  jazz  blues and rock? Step one get out a pad and kill your writer's block… start! I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb But when I laid them down in ProTools They all came out wrong!,21 Concepts,2006,Hip Hop

2585,I want you to ask yourself one question If you had twenty four hours to live  what would you do?   That's some deep shit right there  a lot of pressure How would you handle it? Mase  what would you do?  Yo  I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal I'd even look for my dad that I never knew And show him how I look in my Beretta  too I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto Show them what they could have if they never settle Take every white kid from high class level Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto Teach niggas how to spend  stack the rest Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress Give every bum on the street cash to invest And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request  Yo  yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket  f*ck it I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket Then go get a jar from Branson And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson Load the three power  hop in the Eddie Bauer And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour Get a fresh baldy  make a few calls Shop at the mall  shoot a lil' ball Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time Spread it out on different floors And I'm gon' play lotto  for what? Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow  so what  You know when I was close to the ledge I'd probably be in the wedge With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds Thought of momma  wrote her a note  we ain't close I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat F*ck around and sniff an ounce of raw  bust the four Fours  pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor Jump in the whip  git them cats I wanted to git Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six Went home took a shower in nice cold water And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter  If you had twenty four hours to live just think Where would you go? What would you do? Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify? Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?  If you had twenty four hours to live just think Where would you go?

What hey yo  if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw Run all them papi's spot  put one in his head at the door For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve The other eight had to be baking soda by itself So papi f*ck you  you dead now  I'm off to the bank With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face F*ck her in the safe  and have her take me to my place We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad For my son to have the same shit his pops just had And when I'm down to twenty three  I'm a be strapped wit TNT Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me  If I had twenty four hours to live  I'd probably die on the fifth Run in the station squeezin the inf' I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin' I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms When they come in with the bullets  you prepared with the bomb So f*ck bein' violent get stocks and bonds  Twenty four left until my death So I'm gon' waste alot of lives  but I'll cherish every breath I know exactly where I'm goin'  but I'mma send you there first And with the shit that I'll be doin'  I'mma send you there worse I've been livin' with a curse  and now it's all about to end But before I go  say hello to my little friend But I gots to make it right  reconcile with my mother Try to explain to my son  tell my girl I love her C-4 up under the coat  snatch up my dog Turn like three buildings on Wall Street  into a fog Out with a bang  you will remember my name I wanted to live forever  but this wasn't fame  If you had twenty four hours to live just think Where would you go?

2595,"It was a hot summer day  I was dyin from the heat
Walkin up 118th street
Although I'm hot like stew
In the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew
Now a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst
Or get some boom from the dread  which ever one comes first
Now is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)
So I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)
Now about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew
I looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2
I saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue
And one of them said: all I think about is havin you
Now in my mind I realized I coulda took her  coulda took her
But Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker
Don't mean to diss  but it's not on my list
So I gave her a kiss and said: ehm  good-bye  miss
From the streets I heard a horn beep
There was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep
I heard em speak  he said: my ride is fat
So why you're sweatin D-Nice  baby  he ain't all that
Now first things first  why all the rude behaviour
You shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor
He jumped out the jeep like yo  what up chief
But I don't eat pork  so I guess he wanted beef
I realized I was on my own
I didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown
He swung but missed  I caught him with a fist
Although I wish it didn't have to come to this
I started breakin him down with the speed  had him astounded
The right caught his jaw and it sounded
Like boom boom bap boom bam
He had no idea that D was nice with his hands
He stepped back  so I thought he was through
But right about now up steps his crew
We all threw down and went round for round
I'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down

They proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness
Somehow someway I was damn sure glad this
Person slid me a pistol from behind
Not the weasel  pop-pop-pop goes the 9
So if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them
I (murder them murder them)
But since I pulled the trigger I guess I have to pay the price

2596,"I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East coast  starin out to Africa
Accolades  Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's  wrap 'em up  mad as f*ck  need a ladder up
Escalator  elevator  skyscraper  hella haters
On Primo beats  meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts  hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap  true dat  who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight ' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry  and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy  future of the rap
Golden Era dead {""No time for looking back  it's done""}

We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?

Before I fade to black  face the mirror  face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow  fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me  calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect  I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up  'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper  take his mic  greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price  A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem  we a tight  chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this

We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?

You ever chant with the rebels  dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels  ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go  stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified  exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all  achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out  they 'bout beat  by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young  hell or heaven
Them adolescents  is pedalin  packin metal and settlin
Street wars  revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls  psychos strike the right chords
They at pause  bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack  they lost
Wipe a lot  no time for looking back  it's done

2607,"I stay up all night  I go to sleep watching Dragnet
Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet
I'm so rope  they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise  you know I'm the cool coper
On the mic I score  just like the Yankees
Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spanky
Excuse me young lady I don't mean to trouble ya
Ya lookin' so hot inside your BMW
I got lucky  I brought home the kitten
Before I got busy I slipped on the mitten
Can't get better odds because I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary is a turning and rolling like a ring-ding
Jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
I did the doo-wah diddy and bust 'em with the pre-roll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Don't rat out your boy over some rat weed
I'm out of your back door  I'm into another
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
Not perfect grammar  always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds

Roses are red  the sky is blue
I got my barrel at 'cha neck so what the f*ck you gonna do
It's just two wheels and me  the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
'Cause you know Y-A-U-C-H
I'm taking all MC's out in the place
Taking life as it comes  no fool am I
Going off  getting paid  and I don't ask why
Playin' beats on my box  making music for the many
Know a lot of def girls that are doing their thing
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I'm just chillin'  like Bob Dylan
Yeah I smoke cheeba  it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
People come up to me and they try to talk shit  man
I was making records when you were sucking your mother's dick


Girl  you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes
You got fancy things that goin' up your nose
You're getting fancy gifts from expensive men
You're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection  getting girls' affection
If your life needs correction  don't follow my direction
You got your 8x10  your agent  your Harley
You'll be driving around Hollywood  yo  sorry Charlie
'Cause I'm running things like some mack motherf*cker
You'll be slipping your slack in your face
'Cause your a false fake sucker
You slipped your slack  you cock me and you're wack
While I'm reading ""On The Road"" by my man Jack Kerouac
Poetry in motion  coconut lotion
Had to diss the girl because she got to emotional
Are you experienced little girl?
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
'Cause I'm on your mind  it's hard to forget me
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out  y'all PCP  song out
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
And I'm out",3-Minute Rule,1989,Hip Hop

Well you're lookin' at him now  cause the man is me And if you don't believe all the things I say I'm certified 'prime' by the USDA  Now the name that I use is DJ Run And I'm a fast-talkin' slow-walkin' number one And if you don't believe all the words I say Then you're a natural born fool who's got to be that way  I got a fifty rating and a fifty share Every minute  every hour that I'm on the air And when I come to town  I'm on a big marquee It says (DJ Run) and me  D.M.C.  And if you find that you don't like my ways Well  you can send me back in thirty days  A good job and lots of money might not be enough And to satisfy your needs it may be rough But I take some care and treat you nice And if it ain't sufficient once  I cold work it out twice  And if you find that you don't like my ways Well  you can send me back in 30 days  I'm gonna give you everything that you ever need If you need a pint of blood  then I'll even bleed If you're lookin' for a car  I will buy you two And if you're lookin' for a pet  I'll buy a kangaroo  If you need a vacation  we can fly the world And you'll know I'll never look at another girl I'm a single-minded man  and my mind is set You're the lady of the '80s that I'm gonna get  And if you find you don't like my ways Well  you can send me back in thirty days,30 Days,1984,Hip Hop

I know everything you wan do
I did all that by the age of twenty-one
By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch  I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar  I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you like f*ck this is child abuse
Call diapers  I might just be gettin' nicer
Them young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new twenty  nigga

I use to play the block like that (like that)
I use to carry knots like that (like that)

I got the fully in the tux
That was my past  now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun army  got a slum army
To hire a gun army  get you spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly
Listen to R and B when we get the call he's
No longer wit' us  fire your babysitters
You lil' f*cks fall back for real

2630,"What up on my Harlem niggas
My BK niggas
Back uptown baby
Lennox Ave.
My Oyas on Broadway all day

Aye yo you love the way I rep black
Step the f back
'Fore I bring out the guns
And chest check
Respect that
Any girl I met that 
Hit that
Love the way I spit that
I don't kit kat
Push your wig back
Get you shit snatched
Get your ribs cracked
Got a friend
Have me kick that
Get that 
Sit back
School shit skip that
Learn how to flip pack
For the big stacks
And the big act
Now I got the big gats
Click  clack  uhh
Since day one been in a ditch
Came with a snitch
Now I'm in the pen in the mix
Friends sending me flicks
Girls sending me kicks
Been in some shit
Had to tap a chin with a fist
When the ?
Begin with a stich
End in a kiss
So yo so I blend in the mix
Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
8½ on the dope ask Dominican Rich
Winning and rich
Eating on cinnamon grits
Grinning and shit
How a nigga spin in 6
See they all see the 12
But you see me in it
TVs in it
BBs kinted
Ask who it is
You see me tinted
I did drive-bys
Now I take you on top of a high rise
See if you can sky dive
I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
How 'bout the Palladium
F*ck it Yankees Stadium uhh
Play people  jumped up and sprayed people
I got dudes that'll jigg you with a AIDS needle
You not a threat
You want it you got it bet
I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet
Nigga wait now I'm set
I'll go another route
Kidnap your family make you brother eat your mother out
After I done dug her out
Needles to drug her out
Pillows to smother out
You don't give a f*ck about  I'm what a thug about
I'm through wit' it
Your crew ain't even true wit' it
I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
I know you pack like that
But Cam why you act like that
SHUT UP nigga clack clack clack
Pat pat pat
Rat tat tat
Put fear 'fore envy
Nigga I'm not in fear of any
I'll leave a nigga black and blue
Like a pair of Pennys
While me and Betha
Throw fiestas 
By alma queta
Chicqueta
Monero
Nieta
Don't ever f*ck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the Jon Cletta
Or the black boots
Jumpin out to act cool
Cars never lease 'em
Girls ? 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants got a crease in 'em
All calls valid
Never hard mallet
Dallas 
Been up in you favorite star's stlyus
Coward
Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
But you should thank Un though
Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door
Gun hold for fun though

Guy- Yo  yo  yo  yo (Cam- What's up?) what the f*ck is wrong with you
Cam- F*ck that it's not a game
Guy- Yo  you ain't gotta be rythmin for niggas like that
Cam- Man f*ck them niggas be	
Guy- Yo  you know what you do
Cam- What?
Guy- Tell these niggas the real deal
Cam- Aight check it

Aiyyo I'm ?  cook up the crack
Everytime you look up a gat
Got you shook up attack huh
Look in the back  nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up in check
On this work of the rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the f*ck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns  you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner and you're a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain dead
Light this herb 
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnapings and hostages
So  y'all better obey
We shoot pro way 
Mess with us no way

[Movie Quotes Intro]
Well this is the effect  all these films beginning ???
The kids are very impressionable.  Three?
They see all these films and they want to imitate their heroes.
What heroes though?
All they see is robbers  rapists  muggers  and murderers.
I'm impressed  you're a killer.

[Mr. Lif]
Yo
The plans' covered in asphalt
The Lord told me that its man's fault 
For perpetuating detrimental ways of living we can't halt
Everything inside ya move
You're caught inside a homicidal groove
Where only the idle loose
By violating one of life's most vital rules
Thou shalt not
But hell is a foul spot  where many are misinformed when they are taught
And thus cherish the untrue
Then die for the lies that they clung to
Del and I were there when they hung you
And as you swung to and fro 
We asked  (where did the humane humans go?)
With none in sight
We're left to focus on the same stunning fight
That spites the same force that put the sun in flight
So I summon night
The lack of light left some in fright
And living in fear
With something they couldn't bear
I promise to tell the truth and the whole truth
I solemnly swear

[Chorus 3x]
Left
Right
Up
Down
Diagonal
Three-hundred and sixty degrees

[Dj Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Progression  the lesson
I figure out which direction  then jettison
Minimalize perplexion
Flesh and bone  that's just a physical
I got a spiritual
Awareness  I have risen to
Its not mystical  something that I listen to
When these plastic motherf*ckers try to get in-to
My cypher  I ciphen they blood like they split in two
Yeah  Del  repel  arduous
The purest  give 'em service
With no insurance
Evil
I see through  like cellophane
Knowledge of self  that's why people see Del is strange
They want to humanize the most demonic dudes
Apply harmonic rules
Decide  who is the guy
Americas'
Just like a pair of glove
Don't want to share with us
Anarchy  tear it up

[Chorus 3x]
[Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Mr. Lif then Del alternating stanzas]
The new era  brings terror
You wish the quality of life was better
Peep the dilemma

Yeah life's getting dimmer
Stomachs' gettin' thinner
But your souls keep you full  obesity is for sinners

The sentiment lingers
Low self-esteem hinders

I tell my people 'bout slavery  no one remembers

Maybe they ought to take a look in they mirrors

Like Michael Jackson  and they actions gettin' clearer

Beware  the imagery might scare ya

If you ain't close to the source  then you don't like prosperity

One or many waitin' in line for therapy

But everyone bear a seed
Pure as the air we breathe

I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should  And if my children knew  I don't even know what I would do If they ain't look at me the same I would prob'ly die with all the shame ""You did what with who?"" What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? ""You risked that for Blue?"" If I wasn't a superhero in your face My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake And you go online and see For Blue's tooth  the tooth fairy didn't pay  I'm never gonna treat you like I should",4:44,2017,Hip Hop

Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon

And I pretended I was sleeping (uh) and I was hoping

It's 5 o'clock in the morning  and I want ya
And you want me  don't ya?

Cause you've been waiting on me since I said that I was hittin' the club

Something coming up on me

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me

And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (oh)
And then ask me kindly (oh)

They like the hype and I like the mic
We both like to fight  them girls like to lips me

Don't take part if you don't like drama  that's risky

Verse One: Grymreaper

I floss my teeth on the gospel tracks
I'm not an apostle  but I bring the axe to ya back
I chew and attack
Like Crest on plaque
After that  your world is flack
You drop into a hole
Your mold separates from your soul
Behold  the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware'
But you didn't listen
So now we appear an' eardrums glisten  ha ha

Chorus

Verse Two: Gatekeeper

When I wreck I commence to ditect
Ready to disect so come step alive and die
Next murder is mayhem
Diggin graves is irregular
Treach-orous mangler
Tha Boston Strangler
Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
Daredevil  the rhyme rebel my heart terminates
Subduin and pul-ver-i-zin ya head
Ya bled  fell dead  and your tombstone red

Darkness shall fall upon y'all
who slept on the styles

Verse Four: Undertaker

In the mind I come with the sparks from the attic
Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
Twist lifting mist like riff of a Taurus
Deep in tha forest  I slay for tha porridge
Yet is gold  ya die slow like a tortoise
Deep in my chorus  ya result Diggamortis
Let me see I'm castin disease
Contrary  yet some fairy 'cause ya bleed

Verse Five: Rzarector

Demonic  ya sonic is bangin like chronic

I came on the scene
in a wheel that Ezekiel seen
to exploit your flaws like Philistines
Look in the sky  oh my  it is I
No alibi  so don't even try

I might as well give this up like heavy sales And just f*ck an leave D12 and this blunt We can't self destruct I've never felt it this much Come on fellas  get up We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life  I walk with a limp  pistol hanging off-a the hip I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick We can't take you serious  you a comedy skit You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's But the only thing you shoot is the breeze I can't believe you speaking on moving key's But every time we hear you kick it The only thing you selling is wolf tickets I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack So when they bust you better bust back And get your guts clapped outa your stomach And when they want it (yeah) I bring a hundred niggas from runave So get your gun and if you coming  [Chorus]",6 in the Morning,2004,Hip Hop
2718,"Niemals wird es wieder so werden wie es war und deshalb nehm' ich meinen Stift und markier' mir dieses Jahr in meinem Tagebuch mit einem schwarzen Rand. Alles begann damit  dass Take That aus den Bravo-Charts verschwand. Einfach abgelöst von einem Dancefloor-Act. Ich wurde damals Zeuge wie so manche Fans vor Schreck i Ihren Piercing-Ring verschluckten und den Teddy fallen ließen denn Howard und Jason und wie sie alle hießen die gehörten ganz nach vorne und nicht in den Hintergrund. Meine Schwester wählte sich für den TED die Finger wund denn für ihre Stars hätte sie alles unternommen. Doch damit nicht genug  es sollte noch viel dicker kommen. Take That war ihr einziges Hobby. Es war schon verdammt schwer für sie als sich Robbie vom Rest der Band trennte - das war nicht ihr Glückstag Doch dass sie sich dann ganz auflösten brach ihr das Rückgrat.  Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen. Weißt du nicht  dass sowas Scheiße ist?  Es ist schon wirklich seltsam  wie die Dinge gehen. Ich schaue mir die Welt an  kann sie manchmal einfach nicht verstehen. Ich weiß  das Leben ist nicht immer fair   Doch die Erde dreht sich weiter  als ob nichts gewesen wär'.  Wir wussten damals nicht  wir krank sie war versuchten es mit BSB  dem Methadon für Junkies dieser Art  kauften alle Poster  Weihnachts- und Osterausgaben von Bravo-Girl und Mädchen  wollten bloß darauf warten dass sie die Jungs vergaß  doch sie aß kaum einen Bissen  wollte nichts von Backstreet Boys und Bed'n'Breakfast wissen und so blieb das Kopfkissen in ihrem Bettchen nass und eines Tages kam der letzte Auftritt bei Wetten dass? Unvorstellbar  diese Massenhysterie. Ich verstehe nicht  wieso sich die Verfassungsschützer nie mit Take That beschäftigt haben  denn sowas gab's nicht einmal bei Scientology oder den Zeugen Jehovas. Und Thomas Gottschalks Spott half auch nicht um die Fans zu beruhigen  es war einfach unglaublich: weibliche Tränen  unbeschreibliche Szenen und meine Schwester beschloss  das Zeitliche zu segnen.  Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen. Weißt du nicht  dass sowas Scheiße ist?  Es ist schon wirklich seltsam  wie die Dinge gehen. Ich schaue mir die Welt an  kann sie manchmal einfach nicht verstehen. Ich weiß  das Leben ist nicht immer fair  doch die Erde dreht sich weiter  als ob nichts gewesen wär'.  Dann nach dem letzten Lied kam's zur Eskalation. Es war während der Werbung  als der Rest der Nation sich 'n neues Bier aufmachte dachte keiner daran  daß meine Schwester grad eben aus dem Fenster sprang. Wir fanden sie im Garten  neben dem Hibiskus. Ein weiteres Opfer von Boygroup-Fanatismus. Wann ist Schluß mit dieser Scheiße   Wie viele Teenies müssen noch ins Gras beißen!? Der CD-Player lief noch  ich hörte es deutlich ""How deep is your love"" es waren sechs Meter neunzig.  Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen. Weißt du nicht  dass sowas Scheiße ist?",6 Meter 90,1997,Hip Hop

With this specified time you can do as you please
Make a decision to create life or spread death and disease

We got 360 degrees of emcees
That make these rap niggaz sound like they swangin' from trees
Everythang from brain food to puttin' broads on they knees
We do it all for the love and never all for the cheese

Hot tub  bubbling like warm water call me  hot tub
Cut your wife and daughter like a meat cleaver  we be the Dungeon Family
Niggaz up under the step from A T L to over stand me
D F  is the clique I represent  puffin' purple
Poppin' poppers  spittin' straight pimp shit

Conversation without compensation  we sensed it
It's not to mention yo' girl  your persistant in
Nothin' physical happened but give me 6 minutes
When ya off  somebody gonna fit in it

Say no names  wear my hair longer than your first strang
Yo' girl wish she was drafted for the Georgia drill team
But I ain't gon' say no more
You need to catch somebody else I'm 'bout to hit the door  I'ma

Fine lil' mama  my home gon' be a palace
Laid out like a salad  keep a nigga from malace
I'm movin' things to the south
A dog like me need a pussycat 'round the house  with a row bone

Ain't nothin' like me  you baby with no clothes on
I'm tired of runnin' the streets all night
And a girlfriend ain't gon' stay down witcha like a wife
I can't let all you girls get to my head
'Cuz you know what I want between them legs

Hey I'm just walkin' outta foot locker strollin' through green briar
Stepped in the food court just gonna but a bean pot
Ay cool cool cutta  cut her to the finch
If a girl gotta future behind her  I'm up in it

And I like a pretty lady with a tailback mouth
'Cuz if you hit the right spot  she'll go back runnin' her mouth
Now every time I meet a girl she puttin' her hand in her purse
And when my next record drop I ain't wearin' no shirt let's do it

Hats off  nigga can we put a fist in 'fore we handle business?
Hallelujah  for the bank
Benzes  houses  hummers  tanks and all that
Gon' see  that they meet shack in the end

The world was my enemy  that's who was my friends
On the strong delucious  unstoppable  followin' the tradition of men
Can't say aww look at that man
He's too dirty for industry dead ass  or is he!

Five minutes and fiftynine seconds gone by
Are you really ready for this lyrical high?
We can shoot without bullets  D F to the fullest
Should it  ever come to light it's true art  not hype

Comin' strong  take the mic  make sure it's tight

Ten dimes do too and I ain't take none shorter

Pay attention to every quote we say
'Cuz I got this here like it's in stores today
Holla ready to rock  when he step on the scene
'Cuz shorty stay clean like  shicka-ding shicka-ding

Well I can be that and you need that  freaky D that
And if you want your monologue and open come and seek me
A few done fried man or we can bligh man
I'm the guy that kill ya cat and  I dare you to defy me

If you can time me  I promise in sixty seconds
You'll be intriged and overwhelmed and obligated to rewind me
That reminds me and my name is the Divinely

You woulda been made your way over here to the V.I.P. with us

Where yo' man at? What's the matter with that clown
Leavin' a sharp-ass lil' broad like you up in here with all us players?
Hopefully you up in here with some of yo' friends  so some of my friends
Can get with some of yo' friends and turn it into somethin'

To mix me one of my customized drinks without the blender
Get everybody up in the club up in here off the numb-numb juice
Vodka  7-Up  and Cran-apple juice

The ladies outnumber the fellas six-to-one

Leave skid marks all on the gravel
Drivin' like a bat outta hell to the hotel
Bounce roll rock skate side to side

Now when you see me in the Lamborghini speeding  bumpin Screw
I know you see my license plate  ""Lil' Flip number two""
I use to skip summer school  hit the block and move work
That was enough to buy some shoes  pants  and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff  wearin diamonds like Puff
We got everybody else music sounding like US
So hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been bumpin Screw down here for a while!
And when you see me at the mall  Just me and my dawg
I'm shoppin with them  Cause I ain't trickin for a broad
I do shows and rock crowds  And then I get paid
Summer time  I'm on dubs  Winter time  I'm on blades
My whole click livin laid  man we all got Vets
My crib so big  I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe  Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL  standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice  so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap  so I pimp these streets
You don't work you don't eat  that's a known fact
I just don't rap  nigga I know how to act
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been f*ckin with magazines for a while!

Now when you see me with Tigga  On BET
Or 106 and Park  with AJ and Free
Or MTV  come take a look at my house
And after that  come take a look at my mouth
Yea I represent the South  like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean  like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been talkin shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet  blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10  I'm probably blowin Hydro
So don't blow my high  just leave me alone!
Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tatoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been smokin high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club  I gotta get my floss on
Techno  my ring shinnin  and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone  Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call  you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper  but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider  and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been acting bad  drivin cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin  like UGK
I'm choppin on blades  candy-paint  Jog Grey
I'm sittin on Twenty's  but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin with an AK  you still got a be	-be	 Gun
So you need to Back  Back  and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been ridin around with straps for a while!

2733,Sometimes I just feel like Quitting I still might Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write? Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics And show these people what my level of skill's like But I'm still white Sometimes I just hate life Something ain't right Hit the brake lights Case of the stage fright Drawing a blank like  Dah  dah  dah. dah It ain't my fault Great then I fall My insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just can't do it My whole manhood's just been stripped I have just been ripped So I must then get Off the bus then split Man f*ck this shit Yo  I'm going the f*ck home World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road  I'm a man I'm a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks  man I'ma never look back And I'm gone I know right where I'm going Sorry  momma  I'm grown I must travel alone Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road  Walking these train tracks Tryin' to regain back The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap To the same plant And the same pants Tryin' to chase rap Gotta move ASAP Get a new plan Momma's got a new man Poor little baby sister  she don't understand Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand While she colors her big brother  her mother and dad Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad Sometimes I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet Don't got a rep  my step Don't got enough pep The pressure's too much  man I'm just tryin' to do what's best And I try Sit alone and I cry Yo I won't tell no lie Not a moment goes by That I don't pray to the sky Please  I'm beggin' you God Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are Yo  I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow Tell my mother I love her  kiss baby sister goodbye Say whenever you need me  baby  I'm never too far But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow On everything I own I'll make it on my own Off to work I go Back to this 8 Mile Road  I'm a man Gotta make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks  man I'ma never look back And I'm gone I know right where I'm going Sorry  momma  I'm grown I must travel alone Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road  You gotta live it to feel it You didn't  you wouldn't get it Or see what the big deal is Why it was and it still is To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits It's different and it's a certain significance A certificate of authenticity You'd never even see But it's everything to me It's my credibility You'd never seen  heard  smelled or met a real mc Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me But yet still unsigned Having a rough time Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line When it comes crunch time Where did my punch lines go? Who must I show? To bust my flow Where must I go? Who must I know? Or am I just another crab in the bucket Cause I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but f*ck it Maybe I need a new outlet I'm starting to doubt shit I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with I live like a bum  yo my clothes ain't about shit At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit And it's cold Trying to travel this road Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode My defenses are so up The one thing I don't want Is pity from no one This city is no fun There is no sun And it's so dark Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart From each one of my limbs By each one of my friends It's enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin Sometimes I feel like a robot Sometimes I just know not What I'm doing  I just blow  my head is a stove top I just explode  the kettle gets so hot Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got But I've learned It's time for me to u-turn Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl I can not only play stupid or be immature I got every ingredient all I need is the courage Like I already got the beat all I need is the words Got the urge Suddenly it's a surge Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third I am no longer scared now  I'm free as a bird Then I turn and cross over the median curb Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur I'm Eight Mile Road  I'm a man Gotta make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks  man I'ma never look back And I'm gone I know right where I'm going Sorry  momma  I'm grown I must travel alone Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road,8 Mile,2002,Hip Hop

(intro)   There are 8 million stories in the naked city     8 million stories (x4)     (verse one Kurtis blow)     There are 8 million stories in the naked city   Some ice cold and told without pity   About the mean streets and the guetto culture   The pimps the pushers the sharks and vultures   Things that happen when it reaches dark   And all the things you hear about Central Park   You got to be down you got to have strength   If you're gonna survive past 110th   Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled   The emergency ward is capacity filled   And nothin' ever comes as a big surprise   And the naked city never closes its eyes   A new story every day   Told a thousand different ways   That's how it is and that's how it goes   The city with the 8 and six big O's     New York is a crazy city man.....     Yo  my home boys Run DMC     (verse two Run DMC)     A young girl seemed to be gaining weight   Her parents all thought it was the food she ate   Their attitudes were all la-de-da-de   But little did they know there's a baby in the body   She tried to hide it but they'll soon know   Because sooner or later that baby's got to show   Can her daddy just accept it as a fact   That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack   Then there's another girl her name is Vicki   The girl is fine but sho'nuff tricky   Vicki's fine  but then she's not very kind   She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind   You wake up in the morning and you're feelin' blue   Because Vicki is gone and your money is too   She's more sinister than Peter Lorre   And this is just two of 8 million stories     8 million stories (x12)     (verse three Kurtis Blow)     Fresh kid and the stories complete   Born on a dim lit ghetto street   Father unknown mother astray   He learned about life the real hard way   Wearin' pretty things for all the ladies to see   Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry   Spent all his time just counting his bank   Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha now fill in the blank   Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long   Been the subject of a ghetto song   Poor kids admire ladies desire   They say water can't put out this fire   Because he's a fresh kid yeah he's alright   Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night   And you could measure or even treasure   The thought that cocaine became his pleasure   Puruvian rock never cut with speed   And he gets skied until his nose would bleed   And that was just one weakness must admit   That when he took a hit he could never quit   Because he's one slick pusher livin' day by day   When the crazy thing happened along the way   You know he started to base at a hell a pace   And now it's a disgrace he's got the pipe in his face   For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones   Didn't take care of business didn't answer the phone   He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone   Just bittin' on a pipe like a dog on a bone   Turnin' blue in the face by holdin' his breath   With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest   But then he tried to stop but it never worked   And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk   Just to break it all down you know he's not very slick   Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick   He lost his car his house his friends and his wife   And basing cocaine made him lose his wife   Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay   And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away   In a blaze of glory in his own territory   8 million stories sad but all real stories     8 million stories (x12),8 Million Stories,1984,Hip Hop

I was innocent then  I ain't do no wrong
She said  ""you mommy little man "" I said  ""yep  uh huh""
She was everything to me  when she came  I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp  all did up
It was welfare hustlin'  they killed her for that
The first shot  bullet wound in my back
I'm f*cked up  look at my sneakers  I'm f*cked up
Now I'm on my own  mommy gone
Sam said  ""you a young boy  why your clothes look so old?
You don't need fish  little nigga  you need a pole
You don't need no new kicks  you need an O""
Chop that  bag it  get right back at it
That touched me  it hit me in my heart
I'm a hustler  homie  you was giving me my start
I am what I am  Sabrina's only baby
Practicing in the mirror  pulling out my .380
Oh man  I f*cked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will  see
Seven grams of cocaine  three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look  I'm outta control  my gun go
Off like it's legal  call the cops  you need to
Give 'em my description  I ain't bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn't last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left  in case niggas try to get me
That's nine shots  we just call it fifty

I wake up late every morning
Managers calling  I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeup's
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on I was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
And deres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5

So you gotta do somthin' for channel you
Channel who sorry who I'm half way through a snooze
Oh! Channel you the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Prices boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my red bull and my sandwich  I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum  action
No I'd actually id rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up she actually looks quite sweet

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back cause I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
I ain't no early birdy
Won't wake up till 12:30
Would it be bothered to say much ere
So oh dear
Huh where am I man?
This? ain't good? what's going on?!

So my label would change my image
I'm a pink lipstick chick called dipstick
This ain't on my wish list
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting see-beebies
Have you seen me?
Never again  am I drinking lambrini
Its alright Sov it's a dream just wake up?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working the 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy I'll say it again

I took my mind on this road  way through
I take your mind on this road  you do
I took my mind on this road  way through

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me
These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways  where I'm supposed to go
Ah  shit  get out my pocket

The stench from the smoke could smell so ferocious
Winos in the alley  nearly slumped over
Demons in they eyes  glassy  no Folgers
Wake up sober  kill you for a cold one
Snotty nosed rascals  big ratchet toters
Give it up slowly  click  clack  it's over
Something like Velcro  stay attached to corners
Hood rats plotting  riding for the blue cheese
All for the Gram  grams and a new weave
All they gotta spend expands  and some loose knees
Niggas taking chances  tip-toeing with two P's
No one's a simp  weak or strong they do bleed
Candle light vigils  closure if they do leave
Bullets have a name defined by different calibers
Concrete jungle  beware of different challengers
Gotta have the stomach for dookie bags and catheters
Play your cards right or be scratching off them calendars

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me
These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways  where I'm supposed to go
Ah  shit  get out my block

These waters are murky  crocodiles they lurking
Murder rate merging  up and down virgins
Guess you gotta play street versions of a surgeon
Keep beat bursting  closing down all your curtains
When shit don't go right  gotta question your purpose
Denim with them serpents coming back to surface
EBT  zero balance  worthless
You either leave in limousines or them hearses
Too much bad blood  another problem emerges
You started the problem you motherf*cking deserved it
Politicking  a lot of liquor  that be the answer
They Marlboro  trying to trick them  they be the cancer
Gotta get that loose change  you gotta kick a nigga brain
Like your name Liu Kang  that be the mantra
Stop  look  listen  that's the words to live by
Know you gotta stake your claim  like a rib-eye
90059  nigga  here's why

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me
These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways  where I'm supposed to go
Ah  shit  get out my pocket

A force from the rap game my nigga  this ain't a circus
There's no Ringling Brothers  no Barnum and Bailey
Clowned ass niggas get marked out daily  trucked out lately
Bitch niggas get they hat brought to them  you don't communicate
Well hands and the gat talk to you  what's the convo?
Don't think fast  you end up getting a combo
Think situations is calm  then they bomb though
Sleeping in the bando  it's either death or jail
Something you never planned for  dreaming about Lambos
Wake up shivering  pillow next to a lamppost
Straight up out the motherf*ckin' crockpot it's Watts
One stops leave you with dope  socks is not boxed
No rats  re-rock that got them all losing weight
Got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot
Gotta call up Dr. Dre just for the Detox
All of this in one zip code  keep the streets hot

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me

I'm chillin with my man Phesto  my man A-Plus
And my man Op'  you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland  California and  um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now  yo  we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits  call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends  yo  I can dig it
Here's a forty  swig it  y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler  break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females  so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you  if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one  I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight  so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut  the cinema  was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range  I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat  I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah  this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh  this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill  from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Huh  my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business  I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo  crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops  wanna stop - our fun  but the top
Is where we're dwellin  swell and fat  no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses  this bro's quick
Yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close  kid

I'm posted  most kids accept this as cool
I exit  cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
Or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement  my ace been
Fattenin up tracks  Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

Greenbacks in stacks  don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts  cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit

I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt  folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber  zestin
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

Restin at the mall  attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
Some cute fits  some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this  peepin what my crew gets (huh)
Loot  props  respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit  but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope  why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba  I'mma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

I'm chillin with my man Phesto  my man A-Plus
And my man Op'  you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland  California and  um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now  yo  we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits  call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends  yo  I can dig it
Here's a forty  swig it  y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler  break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females  so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you  if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one  I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight  so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut  the cinema  was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range  I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat  I be the chill from 93 'til

When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business  I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo  crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops  wanna stop - our fun  but the top

2760,"Yeah  last year a lot of motherf*ckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherf*ckin nigga)
Yeah  we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem  Marq
(Huh  tell them man  tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it

I got a ho from the East  got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North  a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair  a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife  a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey  the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not  she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister  though
Ice in the whole damn herd
I f*ck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink  who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to f*ck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits  a bitch with ass
A bitch with none  but hey I give her a pass
And I love 'em all  I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems  I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it..
Nah a bitch ain't one

I got a bitch that's old  a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat  a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny  a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing  a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves f*ckin on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano  a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked  a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short  a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all  I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems  I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show
These motherf*ckers all the over the world; the 2 Live style
Of how the bitches treat a motherf*ckin fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes  cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation  dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em  I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter  the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my bitches  cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em  f*ck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham  bam  thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So f*ck how you feel  you f*ckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one!

Ha! Yo Marquis my motherf*cker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll f*ck you right after she f*cks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast  a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man BECAUSE THEY'RE ""Bitches 2""
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap  a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs  I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells  I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty  got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all  I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems  I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me
No a bitch ain't one
(Huh  you know a bitch ain't one!)

Youknahmsayin? I got problems with my motherf*ckin rent Marquis

2771,"Chorus
I'm from the ninth ward[Been there since the day I was born]
From the ninth ward[Got us coming up like a storm]
From the ninth ward[Niggas better sound the alarm]
Here come the ninth ward ninth ward hard

[Magic]
Bitch I was born and raised in the ninth ward
So you niggas don't bother me
You can say what you may about the ninth ward
But I bet you won't follow me
'Cross that canal where my niggas dwell
You know me well
Cause I sold rocks  upon my block
Till I was hotter than hell
Every nigga down here remember me
Nothin' really changed but my gold teeth
I'm still that same nigga from my Flood Street
Only difference now is that I'm on my feet
And I don't sell dope no mo'
Don't rob no mo'
Mane a nigga don't plot no mo'
Cause I'm performing in shows 
Shakin' off hoes
Smokin' on optimos
It'll be a World War 3 f*ck with me
Now my niggas won't let that ride
I'm the only nigga out chere screaming 9th Ward
So people tryin' to keep me alive
Everywhere I go they see the nine on my arm
And they swear that I'm in a gang
But nigga this is a warning  I'm 'bout my hands
Like I'm 'bout them motherf*cking thangs
I'm trouble starter just like my father 
He was raised in the nine
So if you cut my arm it still tated in my mind
No matter millions or which ever the situation might come
I'll never forget you niggas 
Never forget where the f*ck I'm from

Chorus-2x

[Magic]
You know you could take the nigga out the nine
But you can't take the nine out of nigga
Pulling capers is my nature 
I'm addicted to making paper
Got my own way of living 
Bitch I'm from the see-T-see
Where niggas roam around looking for beef
Killing for free 
I take this ward shit to heart 
It's tated on my arm
So me and my niggas never part
I keep you niggas in my mind 
For every clucker that I serve
For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed
To every god damn rock
For every cop that done chased me 
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn
It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone
We learned to improvise on my block
Never had a ball 
We played football wit' a concrete rock
Now picture that
I could never forget my mission
I'm a turn the nine into something bigger that yo' vision
Before I'm done the world'll scream

Chorus-2x",9th Ward,1998,Hip Hop
2772,"Ah yea
Whole world
M-C's
Whose slick?

We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh ass hair
Style baggy out clouts slick
Creamy and fresh east coast to west

Brooklyn
Uptown
To the universal fair
Old school M-C's

I'm slicker this year  I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave A train got the pic in my hair
And what 16 joints later still lounge
Fresh  from flat bush in my baggy booster gets

Style is tight ee's bust the cami' fatigues
50 000 leagues of black  so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the east and wild Crooklyn  New york

Creamy kid yo Smith and Wesson win a blessing
The angular slang blow spots  bang  11
Hangin' like bats 'cause the 12 inch wax
Say scorpio and my hair say 'fro

And my blood say bro  my clics say  ""Eh  yo!""
Make sparks from the barrel me tal pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wild flowers

Scott La Rock had 'em all  I gots the ball
And roll a little panthers through these project halls
The 3 color flag can't hold my baggys sag
7 1 8 to omega

Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of the classic
Now glamour boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year  I'm slicker this year  yea

East born Beast candles on
Lovely all over the city
And your tape deck blasting
7 hours and the phat fly sneakers and the camouflage

To the hip hop nation
To the mix tape crew
To the west coast
To the boogie down Bronx

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And 5 elements posture take a be boy stance
With the gold front shinin'  the baggy pants saggin'
This Brooklyn stylin' got the fly girls smilin'

But I'm climbin'  findin' new ways of rhymin'
Not livin' like a star is strickly about survivin'
Divin'  deep into the groove of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles

Yes  the notorious  with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes of conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional

Lyrical skills of the insect emotion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the 7 and the crescent
Puffin' some expression  manifestin' today's lesson

Stressin' the fact that I'm solar guaranteed to go far
'Cause the mind is inter stellar
Still pieced like that so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year  I'm slicker this year

To the queens everywhere
To the whole S I
To the lumpen mass
Don't forget about your peeps when ya

Now you see that I am 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter  play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn  any order

You want 'em I got 'em drippin' like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing  moving within the truth circles
We played you made you change strictly ought to

We stratify our wealth from my looty in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm a 'bout to meet my home girl 'cause we be alike
A alike  see alike  let's G alike

2777,"Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest  Nobody understands what it takes to be the man Having every single person say you can't when you can To give up everything you've ever known for a dream And never stop the fight no matter how hard it seems You sacrifice  you bleed  you sweat  and you cry Doing everything you can not to lay down and die When you fall and you call out  there's no one to help So you've got no other option but to pick up yourself At the end of the battle you're the only one standing Everyone watching  the stage you're commanding The pages of history will speak of today And when they talk about the champion This is what they'll say  Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest  People will break you right down to nothing if you let 'em They'll say  ""There's a million others like you  what makes you better?"" But remember that these folks are afraid of the unknown They're the ones who wet the bed if they go 10 miles from home Stay Down: Is what they scream in your ear The only weapon that they have to use is fear So you take all the beatings and you take all the hits  But your back on your feet for more  you don't quit You'll never back down  never stop  never pause Never give up  never sacrifice the cause This is your life  you gonna let somebody take it? Look in the mirror That's all you need to make it Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest  The smoke has all cleared  and you own the throne You're king of the castle  and everybody knows They bow in your presence  and fear your might Cause they know for damn sure what it  what it  Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest",A  Cut Above,2009,Hip Hop

Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true  the makings of you)

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby  caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy  you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy  you remind me  remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys  you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true  these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold  baby; you should know
Baby  you remind me of so much
And  baby  you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims  you shine

Boy  you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around  looking like a superstar
Boy  you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me  and you're my property

Looking at you  looking at another  baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure  baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist  it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips  armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys  you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip  you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine  and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

It's when I'm goin' right

Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more

To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Wanna take a chance

2789,"Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die But some cry  and gets by  while others choose to wonder why His life was took at such an early age A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gage  He used to hustle on the street corners His mom would always beg him to quit  but he didn't wanna As he got older  he got even worse 'Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse  A cold night in his hood  he had a tangle The brother he was squabblin' with  had broke his ankle Laid him out in the driveway Some people knew he wouldn't survive  but hey  I ain't the one to speak up on another's All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook  He had a baby that he couldn't raise And she will never see her father again  'cause he's in a grave I always think about [Incomprehensible] ""My daddy was a dopeman  so I'ma be a dope dealer""  How will the family explain it? ""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head"" He ain't around to see her walk Dry her eyes when she cries  pick her up when she falls  Just the thought of a kid livin' fly f*cks me up When his girl has to raise a bastard child It gets deeper  he used to punch her and beat her She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater  She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card Had a kid  now she's realizin' life is hard A big time dope dealer's all she wanted Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it  The situation's got me guessin' But the answer remains to be a question He lived his life in a lie I guess you only get a minute to pray  and a second to die  It was crazy how it happened Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin' All I could see was a pistol spittin' rounds And the boy was just screamin' as he fell to the ground  A woman yelled  ""Get an ambulance"" But I knew he was dead  he didn't stand a chance You shoulda seen him  he was scared A bullet goes to his chest  and one to his head  He just laid there in silence And all I heard was the siren Paramedics pulled up Followed by a law man and in came a firetruck  Put his ass on the stretcher But if he survives  I'm willin' to betcha He'll be out for revenge They patched him up within a week  he was back at it again  Went to his brother on the North side Grab your shit  it's a hit  we're gonna take a long ride Packed it up in the trunk AK-47  M-11 and a pump  Rolled by [Incomprehensible] on Scott Street School was lettin' out ""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?""  Watch me Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun  he shot him  Put his tooly on the front seat Continued his mission  as he headed down the street The kids was just starin' at each other J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother  Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port Full speed down Reed  shot his mom on the porch On his way down Collard His brother was just dazed in a shock  ""Why you do it?""  Why you shot his moms Jay?

2790,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell About this guy you all know him  he had me scared as hell! He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred! He wears the same hat and sweater every single day And even if it's hot  outside he wears it anyway! He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!  [Fresh Prince] It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right And we had just gotten back off tour last night So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies I got Angie  Jeff got Tina Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life That was all right because the lady was chill Then we dipped to the theater set to ill We saw Elm Street and man it was def And everything seemed all right when we left But when I got home and laid down to sleep That began the nightmare  but on my street!  [Fresh Prince] It was burnin in my room like an oven My bed soaked with sweat  and man  I was buggin I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30 It had melted it was so darn hot  and I was thirsty I went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke Flipped the TV off  and then I almost choked When I heard this awful voice comin from behind It said  "";You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!""; Man  I ain't even wait to see who it was Broke outside my drawers and screamed  "";So long  cuz!""; Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin Then thought  "";Oh  I get it  I must be dreamin""; I strolled back home with a grin on my grill I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill I walked in the house  the Big Bad Fresh Prince But Freddy killed all that noise real quick He grabbed me by my neck and said  "";Here's what we'll do. We gotta lotta work here  me and you. The souls of your friends you and I will claim. You've got the body  and I've got the brain.""; I said  "";Yo Fred  I think you've got me all wrong. I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long! Look  I'll be honest man  this team won't work. The girls won't be on you  Fred your face is all burnt!""; I patted him on the shoulder said  "";Thanks for stopping by.""; Then I opened up the door and said  "";Take care guy!""; He got mad  drew back his arm  and slashed my shirt I laughed at first  then thought  "";Hold up  that hurt!""; It wasn't a dream  man  this guy was for real I said  "";Freddy  uh  pal  there's been an awful mistake here.""; No further words and then I darted upstairs Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed Pulled the covers up over my head And said  "";Oh please do somethin with Fred!""; He jumped on my bed  went through the covers with his claws Tried to get me  but my alarm went off And then silence! It was a whole new day I thought  "";Huh  I wasn't scared of him anyway.""; Until I noticed those rips in my sheets And that was proof that there had been a nightmare  on my street  FP: Oh man  I gotta call Jeff  I gotta call Jeff Come on  come on Come on Jeff  answer  Come on  man JJ: Hello? FP: Jeff  this is Prince  man Jeff  wake up   Jeff  wake up JJ: What do you want? FP: Jeff  wake up  man   listen to me  Jeff JJ: It's three o'clock in the mornin  what do you want? FP: Jeff  Jeff  would you listen to me? Listen  whatever you do  don't fall asleep JJ: Man! FP: Jeff  listen to me  don't go to sleep  Jeff JJ: Look  look  I'll talk to you tomorrow  I'm going to bed {FC} RRAHHHH! JJ: Ahhhhhh!  FP: Jeff! Jeff! {FC} Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa! JJ: Ahhhhhh!

2792,"Stay out!  You couldn't see the clearing from the road So  alone I sit  my legs folded and eyes closed This is the place that I go To come to grips that my sanity's juxtaposed With insanity  overload And I'm afraid of my soul When I'm back here  I'm all alone There ain't no screaming for help When you're gone  they'll never know  All the way to the drowning Heavy stick in my hand and my heart  it keeps pounding I'm holding them under And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder See I hunt them like wild lions And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife Taxidermy like Mormons  stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs The thing that's important  is to never dispose of the edible organs Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs A place in the woods  where no one will hear you dying or seeing you live again Rest here  you're home now  I'll keep you here with all of them  Sometimes when you look in the woods  the woods... Look back ""I don't like to be-"" there's no one in the... I am the woods Do you believe in the devil? I- I shouldn't of gone in there Stop going there  -do you go in there for?

2810,"Wake up

Wake up  get a hold of your life  go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat  or you get ate up
Straight up  you tired of waiting  go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us  I  I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put  put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But  but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color  creed  or your religion
Priests  politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position  we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position  we still ain't got a pot to piss in

Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still  knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Ow  trying religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery  there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
To steal your face  [?]
I'm G-O-D  to infinity  for real

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah  just you and me

Poor reparations  the Bush administration
Unequality  martial law  segregation
False hood  false teaching  false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us  they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey  Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image if we were swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life  but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long  spiritual life lessons
That I recite with song
Trying to wake up everybody  can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist  Staten Island  stand up  stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah  just you and me

Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin'  striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another  that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum  alaykum as-salam
We want justice  police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast  get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them  translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together  together how we are
To stand with a plan  provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah  just you and me

But I'll hit the blunt  So she took out her fronts  Cracked the Philly  Opened the bag and laid out the skunk  Then I took a long pull  It was hype outta sight  We ran into the bedroom  So I cracked my pants for head room  Later  tossed the covers  And oh  brother! I was wit' it  Ready to hit it  Asked my dick  ""Yo  wassup G?""  ""Yo man  shit's thick""  Licked her down her belly  And kissed her on her back  Stuck my hands between the legs  And I felt the ball sack  As big as mine (Yo!)  This bitch must be craze   So I threw my suit on  And I was Swayze...  'Cause I'm the:   [Chorus]",A Day of Sooperman Lover,1992,Hip Hop

Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true  the makings of you)

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby  caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy  you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy  you remind me  remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys  you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true  these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold  baby; you should know
Baby  you remind me of so much
And  baby  you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims  you shine

Boy  you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around  looking like a superstar
Boy  you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me  and you're my property

Looking at you  looking at another  baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure  baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist  it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips  armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys  you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip  you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine  and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

J'ai changé d'adresse  de numéro (merci) J'ai balancé tes lettres et tes défauts même si J'ai fait semblant d'avoir trouvé la force Je garde au plus profond de moi tout ce que tu m'as aimée  J'essaye de t'oublier avec un autre Le temps ne semble pas gommer tes fautes J'essaye mais rien n'y fait je ne peux pas  je ne veux pas Je n'y arrive pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi! J'essaye de me soigner avec un autre Qui tente en vain de racheter tes fautes Il semble si parfait mais rien n'y fait je capitule Je ne peux pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi!  Lui  il a tenté de me consoler Même si il n'a pas tes mots ni ton passé C'est vrai mais il n'a pas ton goût pour la fête Pour la nuit  pour les autres  pour tout ce que je hais Il a séché toutes mes larmes  tu sais Il a ramassé mes pots cassés Et il a réglé tous tes impayés  tes impostures  tes ratures Tout ce que tu m'as laissé Il m'aime comme un fou  il me connaît par cœur Il me dit je t'aime parfois durant des heures Mais il ne sent pas ton odeur Pourquoi je te respire dans ses bras Sors de mes pensées!  J'essaye de t'oublier avec un autre Le temps ne semble pas gommer tes fautes J'essaye mais rien n'y fait je ne peux pas  je ne veux pas Je n'y arrive pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi!

Tu me restes comme ça Je veux t'oublier Reprends tes rêves et disparais Car je veux l'aimer comme toi  J'essaye de t'oublier avec un autre Le temps ne semble pas gommer tes fautes J'essaye mais rien n'y fait je ne peux pas  je ne veux pas Je n'y arrive pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi!

Intro:
A little of this and a little of that (and a little of that) (x4)

Verse 1:
Check it I get the gumtions to make your conjuction function
So honey get it straight or be on your roller blades and skate
My style switch fast like a rash then it get you itchin'
My flow is crisp like a bucket full of Cornnels chicken
I mold the beat like pottery lyrics flow like blood through the artery
With more rhymes then numbers at the lottery
You know my stello have my doe and watch me drop a flow
I wax shit up and make it shine like I was Mop & Glow
So come on baby love let's put it on no fakin' moves
Let's flip on it heads I win and tails you lose
GOT CHA
Grand Puba comes with alladat 
Because I got more game then quarters in the laundry mat
Uh we keep it tight the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me
No doubt cause we hit 'em with...

Hook

Verse 2:
Dig it I got to be one of the baddest brothers on the planet
I'm baggin' honies and they all got bodies just like Janet
I play it save never takin' chickenheads for granded
I'm Superman and Lois takes my rhymes to Daily Planet
I got more promise then timers who makes ? muffins
I do more stickin' in chicken then Stove Top Stuffing
No doubt about it hun I hit from here to China
When I drop the D minor watch me soggy your vagina
Grand Puba  Stud Doogie droppin' clonkite
Prefer the chocolate like the outside of a Klondike
That's how it go and tha'ts the way it's designed
So you can Stoke Me Down I don't mind
We keep it tight and that's the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

Yo man  I'm living grandiose  puffin on an Ambassador
Paid in full  kill the bull  like a matador
Flash the cash  make my album cover shinier
My head's spinning like a discus  and if this is (Just a little samba)
Then I'm straight  with the seven-course meal on my plate
I put my leftovers in the doggie bag
I got moves like Mr. Miyagi had
With the ""wax off  wax on "" I'll play you like Zaxxon
Girls love my songs  sunbathing on the back lawn
""Ju-look-mahvellous""
C'mon young lady  get in the car with us  superstar deluxe (hey!)
I'm always animated cause my game's so tight  that I keep it laminated
Well  if that's true  why you living with ya mama?
Shh! It's just a little samba

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)

No you don't (huh?)

You might spot me in Versace suits
When I'm at award shows paparazzi shoot
I own a fly home  four-car garage
With rides for me and my entourage
Hold up  I got a email
It's a female
Girls pressing on me like Lee Nail
I make the hits that you hear on the jukebox (so?)
Chicks come hotter than Arizona rooftops

I got this one  she's a Playmate
When I met her she was looking at my gold Dizzy nameplate
But I had to vacate  I said ""I'm gonna miss our date cause my plane's late"" (Plane?)
Yeah  I own a plane and I also bought a yacht
So I scuba in Bermuda when the weather gets hot
And I travel a lot
The why you livin' with ya mama?
Man  it's just a little samba!

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

I make all the money

No you don't (huh?)
No you don't (what?)
No you don't!

2859,"Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in  there's no turnin back
Initiation  manhoods are tested
Do crime  you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line  cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him  you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block  they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere  just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams  nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo  while you're sweepin the streets  does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action  they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You want to live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died  so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste",A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,2001,Hip Hop

2864,"From where you are
You see the smoke start to arise
Where they play cards
And you walk over
Softly moving passed the guards
The stakes are getting higher
You can feel it in your heart
He calls you bluff
He is the ace you never thought
He played that much
And now it's more than all this cards
You want to touch
You never know if winning this
Could really be enough

Take a look
Beyond the moon
You see the stars.
And when you look around
You know the room by heart

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed  dreamed a night like this

How many times
Have I been waiting by the door
To hear these chimes
To hear that someone debonaire has just a arrived
And opened up to see
My world before my eyes
That silhouette creates an image
On the night I can't forget
It has the scent of something special
I can't rest
If I resist temptation
Oh  I know for sure that I will lose the bet

I walk away and suddenly it seems
I'm not alone
In front of me he stands
I stop  before he goes

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed  dreamed a night like this

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it

Pour qu'on ait même plus rien à se raconter ? 
On a vécu tant de choses 
Et pourtant aujourd'hui tout nous oppose

Projets  qu'on n'attend pas les mêmes choses de la vie

Et que chacun reprenne

Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour

Et qu'on se laisse avec le blues

And my body and soul and mind are pure Never polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure Just lyrics from I to you recited Arrested  bailed but cuffed and indicted Enter the arena as I take center stage The lights set low and the night has come of age Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the Ed is special For I am a bard but not the last one I am my own king and this is my castle Dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last And you can bet your ass  I drop the L when I'm skiing I'm smoking and peaking I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend Can't stop the mindf*ck when it's rolling along Can't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong Broke my bindings the lion with wings Preaching his word in the B-Boy sing I am one with myself as I turn to The Prefer the dreams to reality I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day Or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day Come what may  I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout Fishing for a line inside my brain And looking out at the world through my window pane Every day has many colors 'cuz the glass is stained Everything has changed but remains the same So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day And I am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny Feeling as though somebody were testing me He who sees the end from the beginning of time Looking forward through all the ages is  was and always shall be Check the prophetic sections of the pages  EZ Mike with the Disco Dave He goes by the name of Disco Dave Disco Dave  Disco Dave  Disco Dave Disco Dave  Disco Dave  Disco Dave Disco Dave  Disco Dave  Disco Dave Disco Dave,A Year and a Day,1989,Hip Hop

Come diddy-dumb!
Welcome to this archaeological find!
At the road  witness me
Before the coming of the Sun; 
peeking at you from the Eastern side of Plutonia
Dressed in armor of Order  to meet destiny with a strong Black grip
Ten hun-zu  see you in from the Zero  take 'em to the three
Stand firm at the five; here's a star and a shield to support you
at the nine!

[Brother J]
It's like A - D - A - M
Prepare your mind  run tell your children
Fire  air  water  let the Earth make flesh
Now see from the Father  how funky can you get?
Now my activity is cosmi-tivity
Immortal is my soul  my God  my reality
I'm not measured by tradition  or any type of 'ligion  huh
Not even cosmic dimensions and such
But many fools  they try to post a duel
Try to post a front but they know it ain't cool  yeah
Boy  my mind goes back to things  just like the cosmic battle
When sword was my rattle
Shield was my bib  and sarcophagi my crib
Not measured by my words  but the deeds that I did for God
Illogical god  I was created and formed
Verbal shogun  yes  the cosmic storm
Who? Scrolls to lyrics to bust
I roll 'em up with the papyrus  funk sealed  in God we trust
I laid it down from circumference to dry space
And now I'm back again  quite lyrical  to kick my bass
Energized by another plane
By logical fanatics  when trying to examine my brain
They can't beat me  so they try to eat me!
They can't keep me  so they try to freak me
Positive sin  again and again  degrees in a spin
Verbs all your silly mortal g-g-grin
Make you feel you could drown in some godly waters
Take control of your body like the farmer's daughter
And as you beg for control  what's the reason? What's the reason?
Yo  I am son of the Chaos so my brothers call me Cosmic
the-hun-zu for tribal  Brother J when trying to rock it
Six-foot black boot god in the suit of the warrior
So now I'm taller 'n 'ya check'n me out
A - D - A - M
Prepare your mind  run  tell your children
Fire  air  water  let the Earth make flesh
Now see from the Father  now how funky can you
Get get get get get down  the rhythm must come to such
When it's time to bust  and all the mortals lay crushed...
Dark sun will get darker
'Cause I existed in the valley of the Father
I got whooped by my mate
'Cause the fruit had a taste
Of the curse that served as a marker
Now here we go  to deal  with all the little ""-isms""
To define me in simple ""-ologies "" Hell no!
On with the flow  here we go  sickamo'
Let us slip on back into the Blackwards row
Niggas didn't catch it anyway
They pat me on the back  talkin' 'bout ""Yeah  J""
Well yeah  right
East I flow  East I go
Cover both your eyes  and what do you know?
What do you see? How does it be?
Is it circumference  or what's up  G?
It's like that on the break  with a verbal milkshake
And a godly vainglorious break

[Professor X]
You shall be moved  logical one!
After a clear pouncing with energy from the Sun
At my beckoning - you and your landmark built
Without the Zero pride
Shall crumble  stumble my way to might
[???] pretender - your time has come!

[Brother J]
I once walked the Heavens with Gabriel
Walked through the desert with Israel
Traveled onto Mecca with Ishmael
I'm crucified  resurrected - now ask how I feel
A - D that I AM  that I AM
From Father flesh to Father Solomon
From the pinky to the thumb 'pon my hand
Bring a other Caddy and a tribal j-j-j-jam
But yet I'm judged  leather prophet and all that
Still a pimp  with a crown and a Yankee hat
And yet they ask me  ""Brother  what's the time?""
It's a African drum with some space-age rhymes  man
Yo not at all  I say it's sexual  infectual  delectable
I'm not a masturbating intellectual
And couldn't read it from a book because that bores you all
So come to Umoja  Kujichagulia
Ujima  Ujamaa  and purpose stands for ""Nia""
Kuumba  Imani  daughter named [?]Simani[?]
Came to the planet  Father [?]Afer[?] left his body
So leave the boy in the coffin within
Raise your head  let's the A to the D to the A to the M
This is the message from the Cosmic Storm
With the doubters and the judges  disbelievers be warned!

[Professor X]
With a shield of David on the grill
And the has-been proudly adorned with the color pink
Bring on your G's  your Q's  your are's and your Alphas
It is time - Shalom! And ya don't stop - Sisseeeeeeeeeeee!!!",A.D.A.M.,1992,Hip Hop

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game  juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips  legs  arms  necks
Hip dips  hair net  mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit  every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker  I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them  thick  medium  or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina  in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch  Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white  I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy  he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy  grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up  what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

When I drill  I don't spill  even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered  concealed  and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS  We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low  like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby  elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom  BOOM

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you

2907,See  there comes a time in every  Man's life when he's got to fall in love   And he's got to find the right woman   And I think I found it in you   Woke up this morning to breakfast in bed  The coffee was hot  Them eggs I got was right  so right   Girl I gotta tell you  you're just too good for me  Oh  the things that you do makes it easy lovin' you   Even a blind man can see.

2908,"""It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is LOOSE..
somewhere in outer space.""

""The mysteries of creation are there.""

""Up in the sky?""
""Up in the sky.""

""The moon and the planets are there.
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.
And therefore as we set sail; we ask God's blessing --
on the most hazardous  and dangerous  and greatest adventure
of which man has ever embarked.""

""Prepared for liftoff.""

I self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters  shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower  for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake  causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father  and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell  turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature  narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine  over the frontline
The ten percenters  promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds  above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down  holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker  owner  plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky  the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus  regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life  so who to trust
Who but us  to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth  150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families  we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard  to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Above the crowds  above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down  holdin it down

Five  ten  fifteen  twenty 
Twenty-five  thirty  thrirty-five  forty
Forty-five  fifty  fifty-five  sixty
Sixty-five  seventy  seventy-five ways

Today's in a maze
And start the craze
When they opened my coon
It was time to bloom

Thinkin' like ten people  trapped in one room
Sittin' in my sandbox  sand all over me
Overly anxious to get the mic in my hand
Now who want to blow it up (I do)
Now who can rip it up (I can)

I glide like the ride of a man on a snowboard
When they pick up the microphone I ask him what he flow for
Various degrees of technique that's inside of me
Never try to be something you not- and don't lie to me
Ebony and Ivory
Keys on my piano playin'
Tryin' to test some music  but the rhythm push my your hand away
Easy as the alphabet
Hard as solid rock
Pure as the driven snow
Pissin' on your block
Mark my territory then I'm right back in it when
laughin' w/ the teras of a clown when I grin

I'm manic-depresive ever since I was an adolescent
But I never panic in a sesion when I'm bussin'
Cussin' like a sailor  
With a bottle full of Jagermeister
Ready for whatever this world has to offer me

Plus it won't get off of me
And never ever test me
I'm one w/ the universe
The energy has blessed me
Bet you wonder why you got flaws in your character
Cause you're caught in the ass-crack of America

I just want to help you all but
All I do is stare at ya
You can have a shot of this
Or maybe hit this marija
want to if you want to but
If not  stay drug-free
But  plug me in the mix boy
Right up next to plug three

Talkin' out the side of your neck it ain't a remedy
I just want the whole wide world to remember me
I don't want to have to think you're working for the enemy
Sbotage. You can't conquer this energy

You can be the center of attention if you want to
My party is in the other room and
We're just having fun too
(So I'd like to signify the monkey that's in back of you)
All I want to do is get rid of all the wack in you

Do not get offended because no I'm not attacking you
I don't have to do nothin'  the rapper's start smackin' you
Maybe I should just give you a taste of reality
Welcome to my art show
Its not about a salary

Take two of these a day and burn a couple calories
Me and the mic are like Mickey and Malory
Rockin' like a be	-boy
Part of my anatomy
Hands on your groin'

Old Eddy Hayes it's time to blaze
One of L.A.'s that's born and raised

Now that we've got ourselves a little more acquainted
Ain't it about time I get this picture painted
I am what you call a psycho-analytical
Critical thinker of the formulas we all need

I think I'm running out of brain space in my hard-drive
Plus I need a memory-card for my control pack
Throw that hand up so I can see your finger-tips
I'm about to rip it up better than before

Yeah I had a crazy-people party and invited you
I didn't know my underground hip hop excited you
Now that I know this fact I'm gonna throw it right at you
I just want to give you everything you're entitled to
Down in the Leimert park  hangin' w/ the hooligans
Every now and then I've got to take'em back to school again
Maybe you should call me your hip hop counselor
I'll be on the rhythm when the beats start bouncin' up

I'll give you a minute just to get yourself together and
We can have a sing-along  all and together and
Here's  to the netherlands  sistern and brethren

Yo  this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
Where women and men begin with  and then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts
On thin strips of emotion
A fraction  seduction  attraction 
Eruption of passion corrupts it
Life lasting friendships involved
Would love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

CHORUS (Akil)
We've been friends for a long time
A very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine
But respect the thin line
Love you like you was mine
Think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine
But respect the thin line

AKIL
Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of ya'll
So you respect that
And entertain an idea but get brought
Back to reality
And could you really live with that
Decision  based on intuition
You love and keep it distant
Hug and kiss the friendship

MARC 7
An ongoing friendship
We was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked a sentence
Sometimes you're too intense
In your quest to invent
The perfect man
Please understand my rhyme is your repent

CHORUS (Akil/Nelly) X2
SOUP
Too bad that we became friends first
And I'm not an expert on how relationships work
But  from the minute it was known
It changed the whole tone
The way we spoke on the phone
Yo  it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune
You let me up in your room (damn)
But to me girl you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted
Infatuation was authentic
But yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter  then tear it up
Or do a song just to say what's up
I want just a touch

CHORUS

NELLY
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door
Friendship turned into love
On some weak tip
See I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice with these things that I'm feeling
You've got someone else don't want to be caught stealing
Hell  if she knew she would never leave us alone in the room

CHALI
Yo  this was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first
And then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of emotion

AKIL
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

MARC 7
We was people to begin with
But you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship
Respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we've got an in
I'm trying to salvage a friendship

CHORUS



",Acetate Prophets,2002,Hip Hop
2918,Yo  this is a lesson in friendship The depths of a kinship Where women and men begin with  and then slip My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts On thin strips of emotion A fraction  seduction  attraction  Eruption of passion corrupts it Life lasting friendships involved Would love to cross the line But that's why we built these walls  [Chorus] We've been friends for a long time A very close friend of mine Love you like you was mine But respect the thin line Love you like you was mine Think about you all the time Very close friend of mine But respect the thin line  Opposites attract When the female and male come in contact Sticky situation in fact Trying not to let the feelings catch But there's a thin line between both of ya'll So you respect that And entertain an idea but get brought Back to reality And could you really live with that Decision  based on intuition You love and keep it distant Hug and kiss the friendship  An ongoing friendship We was people to begin with Disrespect was not intended But your feelings sparked a sentence Sometimes you're too intense In your quest to invent The perfect man Please understand my rhyme is your repent  [Chorus: x2]  Too bad that we became friends first And I'm not an expert on how relationships work But  from the minute it was known It changed the whole tone The way we spoke on the phone Yo  it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up Over you all my buddies would swoon But I felt we were in tune You let me up in your room (damn) But to me girl you're still off limits No matter all the times that I hinted Infatuation was authentic But yo I just pretended So I wouldn't lose the friendship Maybe I should spill all my guts Or write a letter  then tear it up Or do a song just to say what's up I want just a touch  [Chorus]  I can't do this anymore See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door Friendship turned into love On some weak tip See I can't comprehend even if I knew it Can't do justice with these things that I'm feeling You've got someone else don't want to be caught stealing Hell  if she knew she would never leave us alone in the room  Yo  this was a lesson in friendship I stress in this sentence Should women and men be friends first And then slip My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips of emotion  Opposites attract And best friends make a perfect match If you only knew that Once you cross ain't no turning back The minute you let him in it and he hit that That's that  We was people to begin with But you was too relentless Jeopardizing kinship Respect is intended Resolve is my intent While we've got an in I'm trying to salvage a friendship  [Chorus],Acetate Prophets,2002,Hip Hop
2919,Out on the porch  Lets have a mid city fiesta with your west LA connections Hop inside the vehicle start crossing intersections We learning life's lessons While we blaze this herbal essence A man was still a child and I have so many questions A struggle on my life till we vade the misconceptions To find a place to live between the negatives and positives While trying to make money slanging synonyms and homonyms I went to pops house so I can visit moms and him Cut to the mall got them brand new pair of Timberlands Then dipped down a one way trying to skew up double k And chill with my people on this bright and sunny day My nigga spliff was sippin' Beck's I'm slappin' hands with guests Ok the shady spot so we can circulate the stress Mary Jane invades my brain now I can't complain I'm sayin' what else is there to do besides relax Let the problems in your mind become ancient artifacts Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate The things that's got you trippin' you watch me demonstrate First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants As the words become a sentence you start to feelin' different The stress is out your mind you feel like the weight was lifted Terrific I'm glad we had this time to discuss I'm outro call me if you want to blaze one up  [Chorus] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops  Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop. I let the music take over my soul  body and mind To kick back relax one time and you goin' find When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops  Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop. Just let the music take over my soul  body and mind To kick back relax one time and you goin' find  I try to keep it stress free take everyday at a time Make sure the families in place and let the music unwind I got men to take charge like major outlet Ride around the country chillin' in my LA Express On every street corner The importance of having fun If he bottle spill tobacco don't nobody carry guns We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin' On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin' Under the blue sky the state laced the small Belucchi quarter inched cables with all the sound that we brawl Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one Feel like a dad at a ball game mappin' with his son Chuck D yo word up we buggin' over time From the light to the lime original star time It's the double crisis one It camel brought the ammo so we can shoot Game like thugs on your sport channel Take off the do-rag replace it with a thinkin cap If you didn't know tell the bro he should have known that We here for one thing and that's to remain What's the name...name...name...nigga  [Chorus] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops  Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop. I let the music take over my soul  body and mind To kick back relax one time and you goin find When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops  Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop. Just let the music take over my soul  body and mind To kick back relax one time and you goin find  Yo L.A. hit me one time make it funky Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin' lucky For this jackpot I jacks pot to feelin' my crips We lay back chillin' and feelin' the music relates We on the to the two hangin' with my crew Bullshittin' while we sittin' down drinkin' our Sabu And to the afternoon turns to the moonlight Funky tracks and nickle sacks freestylin' all night Doin' it right no one with time music make it better My crew banging two blocks like shots from my Berretta Snub no's to the hoes who pose I suppose Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows And I'm leavin' you so by the time I get the phoenix Underground ground hits are goin' to fiend this musical genius Transglobal by the books Like Barnes with noble hooks Armed with overlooked talented guests of while bless crooks Who still lose and keep this shit alive Something for your truths to sit around and bye bye For camel double invest to ease stress We bout to hip hop so have fun and god bless  [Chorus] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops  Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop. I let the music take over my soul  body and mind To kick back relax one time and you goin find When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops  Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop. Just let the music take over my soul  body and mind To kick back relax one time and you goin find  Pop collars to this Wear ice to this Drink crys to this Yo is there somethin' we missed Pop collars to this Wear ice to this Drink crys to this Is there somethin' we missed?

It's like  word up  and it sounds so nice
Hip-Hop  you the love of my life  of my life

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back  the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back  my front  plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying  to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop  you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you  from the door for you
Speak through you  getting paper on tour for you
From the start  Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights  steady rocking the mic
Hip-hop you the love of my life
So tell the people like that y'all
And it sounds so nice
Hip-hop  you the love of my life
We bout to take it to the top

I was speaking  to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection  told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams  and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love  so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R.  eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape  niggas had her in the buff
When we touch  it was more than just a f*ck
The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York  tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight  losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized  that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively  live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life  making the right moves
Besides God and family  you my life's jewel
Like that y'all  hip-hop

I was on my laptop checking on flights to Cancun Chatting over the net like Agassi and Chang do Then a message on screen from the Action Headquarters From the office of the Chief upstairs relaying me some orders I printed out the agenda and instructed process  It read: Your mission should you choose to accomplish...  Another job during vacation I'm not hype on going It's halfway around the world and chances are that it's snowing Can't concentrate...decisions unwise...if I could stay here and think and just re-energize I'm very hesitant trying to resist compliance And recalled I'm required off duty and on assignment An op from the Chief who insist to aid folks I need to get to going before my Action title's revoked Off to lost cities who drown in no hope Feeling the choke but we go to sever the rope Action! Getting Ready for some Action Figure. Put the Word into motion  not only hear that we do that! With my leather bond in hand and game plan on DVD  Under the assumed identity of a black emcee  No disguise needed 'cause that can cause less stress   'Cause action Figures dressed up as bats get a whole lot of press Met my contact at customs  ""How do I know its you?""  Of course the secret password  ""Schlavaboghoul""  The backdrop was set as night hit the foreign nation  Ready for the intake of sensitive information If the barrier was language we'll break the code of silence And amputate what may trigger off their motive for violence Alluded the bad guys in black hats and cheated danger 'Cause the weaponry I use is holding truth in the chamber Since I received word in the form of the prophetic That's my safety latch 'til it's matured cause God said it The Word is like a bullet that must penetrate the heart Just to end the present life to let the new one start Action!

Touched insane deranged and such
But my mind still thinks in the clutch
You run up you get  touched
Molested marauded messed with
I'm charged with electric current
And burn'em so don't  touch
Gimme room to bloom or boom impending doom
Thoughts consume man I got that
Touched panache pizzaz
A feel for the real
Skill and lots of that
So I just build now

While you throwin' punchlines
I'm bustin' hot ones with rhymes (blow!)
Acupuncture smackin' damn nerds like heroine
Swimmin' with sharks I'm off the (Fairline?) Islands
They sense blood in they gills but a nigga will survive man
Automatic darts hypnotic talk
Alive and aware come prepared to collide you'se a dead man walkin'
And I'm the executioner connivin' like Lex Luthor
What they shootin' for?

[Tajai]
Man  I make these corny rappers respire
Break'em for their dapper atire
Then throw that ass in the fire
And ain't no use in askin' me why
F*CK YOU! that's my reply
Step back from the mike
Or I'm snatchin' your lives  right

Niggas be actin' like
They be rappin' tight  but they lost
Like in the black of night
Soon to be my sacrifice
Better be wary of the legendary
'cause your spot at the cemetery isn't temporary
Have you shook up like kids who mention Carrie
Or Bloody Mary if you rappin' near me
Positively somethin' gon' happen really
I ain't got no back up in me
I stay managed
Wether you chill or pack a semi
You can't manage

Touch the inchangeable  Viagra flow  raw
Stronger then Niagra Falls
Max Julien backhand MCs and grab my balls
Hit'em with the black squad and crack your jaw

Now I'm a chastise you rap guys
With wack lies
Soundin' like you doin' smack lines
Claimin' it's your last time

That's why the mass like us
We them grass lighters

Niggas think I got punched by Rudduck
In the stomach the way I bust from the gut & get
G's by the hundred but
That don't matter (fool)
Cause niggas get millions
For shit I ain't feelin'
And that's why I'm building

Yeah
Absolutely  I be rappin' smoothly

Freeze rappers like a tractor beam

On the track queen rap sting

Weapon testin' with my 308 special
Runnin' up in your residences
Runnin' busters for their presidentials
In my sights I won't miss you
Once you gone I won't miss you
Livest nigga be a dead issue
Your flesh is just tissue for my talented talents to rip through
Physical enslaved to my imbalanced mental
My confidence is not confidential
So show deference for my skills diferential

[Phesto Dee]
Yeah I suffocate featherweight MC's never resucitate
Decimated easily as my voice fluctuated sentence structure
This critical juncture for you youngstas
Laser sharp hack ya  cut ya  acupuncture
Play my clutch Midas touch press the gas and light the dutch up
My candy gloss touch ya
Eurethane is such a
Blood rushin' display of luxury and immerse ya
Submerge ya beyond the verge of word perfection

Yo these niggas out a pocket I cold
Cock'em and cock at their nose
Stopping their comment just for haulin' that garbage
My flow  shockin' and suckers with no
Stoppin' a racket
If you fi'n to talk about it
Be about it or get rowdy

I spit that
Liquid detergent
Game like George Gervin
Ice water
Under pressure operate like Julius Erving
The surgeon  hovercraft percusion
With spontaneous combustion
highly flammable magma through the mouth

It's f*cked up  but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin' loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you  high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD  addicted

He's got me anxious
He's what I waited for

Aiyo  get nice
Shoot dice
Skip the small talk
Son  advance to BOARDWALK
Collectin properties and profit
Expand and make dough
Yo  slide past GO

[ Phantasm ]
Check the drama as the saga starts to enfold
To advance and pass GO and get the pot of gold
In the MEDITERRANEAN
Met this fly lady  and
She had two lovers
The rich Parker Brothers
On the run from the IRS for INCOME TAX
After this heist  son  we sittin on stacks
In this new community lookin for the Treasure Chest
Took a wrong left turn  f*ck it yo  nevertheless
It's my fault  kid
We ended up on BALTIC
Off course
But still we ain't takin a loss
There he go  READING at the RAILROAD in his Porsche
Waitin for his brother to come in on the iron horse

[ U.G. ]
Can it be so simple?
Playin in my rental on ORIENTAL
AVENUE passin through CONNECTICUT
Got to get the burn mark just to VISIT Matt Life in the clink (/JAIL)
I'm bagged for stolen minks and snatchin links
[ Phantasm ]
At ST. CHARLES PLACE
Let me check Digga and Masta Ase
And the Inc.
They own ELECTRIC COMPANY
Next is the state of VIRGINIA  with Rhamadan
And got Mad Skillz like Shaqwan
At the train station
We waitin
For my PENNSYLVANIA connect
To come through and show us love and respect
Don't even take aim  cause he's a SAINT like JAMES
And when you're done with the body burn em in the flames

Sippin Hennessy on TENNESSEE
With Hav and P
Seen Schott Free  asked me to walk to NEW YORK
AVENUE  bag two chicks who whips were stashed at FREE PARKING
We seen Lou Diamond with Tony Starks  then
Some kid tried to buck me
On KENTUCKY
Some gang named CHANCE wore bandanas
So I ran to INDIANA
(ILLINOIS/) ILLA NOYZ and his boys
Held me down and got my back
Pass the gat  yes  I'm just cool like that

I was on ATLANTIC
With my man Quick
To snatch jewels and hit the scale
Seen 50  didn't want to GO TO JAIL
On PENNSYLVANIA
I met Lorena
She had on Guess
She said (you need a vest
goin through COMMUNITY CHEST)
Or NC  NORTH CAROLINA if you visit
You look exquisite
????? made by PACIFIC
Kicked a SHORT LINE
Shorty was mine
She was with it
I got the digits
But never got the CHANCE to hit it

[ Phantasm ]
At PARK PLACE
Hit the Parker Brothers' safe
And made a killin
And skated with about two million
But we got to pay TAX on the LUXURY
The Cella Dwellas' plan is to expand and live comfortably

2955,"This is what  this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand  you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust  envy  hate  jealousy
Wicked niggas  man

Yo sit back  relax  catch ya contact  sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back  worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate  we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break  undress em  tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone  fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn  The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone  face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats  politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack  Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche  my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die  he too soft
That nigga's dead on  a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo  the smoothest killer since Bugsy  bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be  I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo  my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit  my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam  made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus  Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo  my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes  we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening  he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars  your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep  all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two  they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team  we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa  Foxy Brown  Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece  laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby  from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz  operation Firm Biz  so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el  sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke  raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a f*cking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth  so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw  chop it in half
Get sixteen  double it times three
We got forty-eight  which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four  subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see  if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me  mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

2958,"Universal as I stroll down the street
Africas's a bolling over flowing inside of me
I used to sport a curl made by Jerry
A Jerry curl
but as time passed it didn't last
after my curl I never combed my doo.
I used to sport a cap but the naps kept shining through.
Shining!
My sista got a brand new perm
my boys says she looks pretty fine body real firm
folds at her job loves her new touch up
I can tell her white boss gets a kick when she's all done up.
My sista loves her blackness
but the US. says that her perm is her attractiveness.
But Africa keeps coming stronger-we found out
it ain't a perm it's a temporary
Don't heve sash to go to the music school
no money for the guitar or the violin or the tuba
my moms had a record player and the 45's
I put the needle on the record and I kicked it crazy live
scratching it up catching the breaks
spirits within me had me do what it takes
Grammy's I win & one again like my Egyptian kin
it's Africa within makin' something outta nothing!

CHORUS: (x2)
Africa's inside me
taking back her child
she's giving me my pride
and setting me free.

What's that land across those waters?
what's that spirit makin'love to my daughter
telling her not to eat he mama's ham hocks
allowing her the choice to twist her hair & make it lock.
yo I don't like it  I just don't like it.
Papa may say buy my soul is a boilin'
and sooner or later Africa's glory and toil
will teach an old dog new tricks
Why and the world can't everybody
recognize that Africa's in everybody?
we all ask why can't we be sista's and brothers
but first we gotta accept who is our mother
Rather embracer of the jungle
or ghetto melanin dwells but could stop growth
and developments Arrested for nothing
Gumbo's within' soulful H20 men be droppin'
Happenin's like Homosapians Hustlins
within' to exist as afro USA...men
residing in Fulani was once Christian.
Start fishin' like FOS and found origin!

2974,"I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again",Again,1993,Hip Hop
2975,"Like an angel out of the sky you came
Clearing up all the clouds of sadness and the rain
So pure you and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside (it felt so right)

For me  I've struggled  all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will  love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again  again  again

I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I'd been through I have had enough
Whispering through your eyes you never said a word
But something said
(You're heart's safe)

For me  I've struggled  all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again  again

A friend is what you always have in me
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
You'll forever be (a secret part of me)

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy
Again  again  again",Again,2002,Hip Hop
2976,"Now I done felt a lot of pain
I done seen a lot of things
From struggling and broken heart to fancy cars (oh yeah)
And even though my money change
I tried my best to stay the same
But you know with mo money
Mo problems came

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t take away the rain
'Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I’ve learn so much from my mistakes that’s how I know he is watching me

In ATL I caught a case
And the media tried to say
I had a habit
I couldn’t manage and I am throwing my life away
But everything ain’t what it seems just because its on TV
'Cause they speculate and exaggerate for a better story

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t take away the rain
'Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I’ve learn so much from my mistakes that’s how I know he is watching me


Nobody knows what life may bring
It might make you happy it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah but I know there’s a reason for everything (but I know)
That’s why I keep believing
Whatever is meant to be its going to be

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t take away the rain
'Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I’ve learn so much from my mistakes that’s how I know he is watching me

This is American fun There is wisdom that is woe  so welcome to my life It was fine until Moby scarred me like a knife Towards thee I sail  thou unconquering whale To stab my spear into your white tail The first one to stop him gets this gold doubloon Now excuse me while I go be melancholy in my room!

The ship's got a hole  plug it up  plug it up!  “We're never going to find this white whale  Are we captain?”  Hey Ishmael… can I call you annoying? Grown up Beluga in the deep blue sea Swims so fast and swims so free With the heaven above  Moby Dick stressing me And this crazy drenched crew below Call it idiot pride  or call me Oedipus My main tragic flaw… “But what about us?” It's your battle too  crew  man vs. beast At least have respect as we sail south and east And north and west  look I'm doing my best While the rain keeps pouring we're exhausted and stressed Pip went insane when he almost drowned  So profound when he shrieks like a little sailor clown Random ships we met warned us of our doom They said our boat would be our tomb Near the Mariana Trench  deep and oceanic We spotted Moby Dick so white and titanic  REPEAT CHORUS I said  “You took my leg  and for that you must die!” I threw my spear and hit Moby in the eye He charged the boat  it began to sink I said  “How about that?

I'm a wise man  prophet of the bible You wanna try me  then I'm liable To go and flow and show  don't you know Edgar Allan Poe  could not write like this  Mysteries  with a twist And I insist  to uplift my metaphor Slice dice and write  and make the brain sore For  you and him  I kill a rapper  then begin To wrote and smoke you're chokin then provoke The joke the most  and walk around like notes Programmed  you're equal to a dummy  Them want rhyme?  You do summies Backwards  forwards  sideways Anyway  I say hold it Now you're in space  plus you're folded  Up  like molecules of matter Plus you scatter  you wish you had a Chance to shake  recuperate  recreate The brain cells  I have ate  Scraped  soak em in solutions Like Benzine  iodine producin Student of Cee's  tryin to be  just like me Ced Gee  the Ultramagnetic  A scientist  skilled with knowledge Once a God  years of college Accumulated  my wisdom and wit Thoughts float  ideas are legit  To fit  the rhythm of the tempo Also  the music more so Have to move groove soothe and lose you Now ain't it good to you?  Once again my rhyme blows up enemies Wack MC's  across the nation on rotation You get the hype at the station Promotion  I put your brain in slow motion  Like lotion  and let it float in the ocean Then I drown it  your brain begins to bubble I bring trouble  hang with Barney Rubble In Bedrock  and watch another head rock  Go through West to Washington and Ced block The Avenue  passin you  bashin you In your face  rhymes are crashin you On the chrome dome  swellin your Astrodome  You're in an ambulance  I'm takin you home To complete the ways I'm on a mission I see your balls of clay with x-vision I'm a scientist  your satellites are weak  They get dimmer every time I speak On my gryoscope you hope to seek the style That copacetically  bugs you out On the mic  Kool Keith in a spaceship  Risin  not followin  plexin Muscle flexin  lyrics for connection Rhyme injection  rhythm perfection Brain selection  has protection  My reflection  shines Triple times your eye  invisible I get by your brain Now ain't it good to you?

But real niggas don't get in court and squeal

Pooh-Man did it! Pooh-Man did it!
He made me with it!
Court is in session  $hort

Hoe trusta Oakland busta 
And you gets no love from the gutter
See we remember when you had to have  
A baserock cawy and a nice hot bath
Smokin' and chokin'  Sir Too $hort
Just thinkin'  about the day before
See you never shouldn't f*ck
With the real killa
I goes deep on you dopefiend nigga
Got on the mic and called me a punk
And funk is what you want

So there it is  junk
Dirty  tired  f*cked around
And get my foot off in his ass
Let's hood ride  mob  f*ck talkin' bad
No punk let?s me check myself  partner

I boarded to your ass last year
But you didn't hear me dough
It's 94 and Banks need a little more
Lips lookin' hell of luscious
Digidy down goes my zipper
Nigga  you can suck this
And you must like slurpin' dicks
Because you ridin' on $hort's tip
Like a jockin' little bitch
Ridin' around  in your too-$hort-hand-me-down
I left the Dangerous Crew
And that's why you're clownin' now
The bigidy Banksta ain't no gigidy gigidy gangsta
When the truth comes out you ain't shit but a pranksta
Try to hang in my hood lookin' out of place
With that blank ass look on your face:
(What should I do? What should I do?)
Now get in where you fit in  chunk
can't hang on the block
Cause you ain't shit but a punk
So I ain't givin' no rule
To assume you want some mothaf*ckin' funk
Then bring it to the crew
So bring it on if your ass want to trip
And to this hollow-tip  bitch
Blast that ass  yes I would
Cause on the streets  nigga  it's all good

Oh  there goes my pager
And it's your bitch  yo  I think I best to fade her
Took her to the motel parking lot
Little light skinned bitch got just a little too hot
it's goin' down  pannies comin' off
Another tramp bitch got automatically toasted
I think you found out and got jealous
Cause I was diggin' your bitch
And runnin' back tellin' all the fellas
But you took her home
And wanted to marry the bitch
I would dig her in this  mister
And bury the bitch
Stop spendin' all your cash and fix your teeth
$hort Dog must like bein' ugly
Came at a nigga wrong
Little cavity creep walkin' around with Nikes on
Bitch ass nigga ain't got no heart
Be ready to finish anythin' your punk ass started
Cause I did funk with the best
So when you ridin' in your lexus
Nigga  put on the vest
And stay the f*ck out my hood 
Cause death is a factor and it's all good

Come on  come on  come on
I wanna hear that shit bump  bump
You know what I'm sayin'
Who ya know with the big cash flow
Beats hotter than tobasco
And I love to see a honey shake her ass slow
By now you should know this ain't a bitch
I won't cut it if I think you can f*ck with it
I be the infamous sparking all these hoes
Interest as we enter this
R&b with a twist j.e. is what it is
Now tell me baby can you handle this
A lot of ice on the wrist make a list to match
Here it so so us cats count doe by the stack
Cause it jumps of racks and stores
Which leads to a hallway of plaques and whores
Those signs that read 'the world is yours'
And when they come on in clubs people pack the floors
I make hits  then I dip with a dip to the tropical
Known to the world as j.d. the unstoppable

Right about now is when I ask you for this dance
Hope you don't turn it down they just put on our jam
And I've been watchin' you til everybody know all night
Don't try to fight this feeling cause all you gotta do is let it go

1- girl this thang is all so serious babe
Waiting long enough let's hit the floor babe
Ain't no stoppin'  we got this place on up
Ain't no stoppin'  we got this place on up
Ain't no stoppin'  can't stop  won't stop
Ain't no stoppin'  can't stop  won't stop  no

Girl you and I know that it's time that we
Put everything aside and dance all night
What you wanna do  I just wanna rock with you
So girl don't shy  put your hand in mine

Repeat 1

I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain
(we got this place on up)
I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain
(can't stop  won't stop no)
I came to bring the pain hard corp to the brain

3046,"Ladies and gentlemen 
They're back once again
And I hope you've all been listening
The Big Brovaz collective are definitely here to stay
And here is what they have to say

It ain't what you do it's the way that you do it

That's right  I mean that's why we love you guys
You're so creative and very innovated... really

And that's what gets results

BIG BRO YEAH!

If you put your mind to it 
You can do what you want
You can see that we did it look
What we've gone through
It wasn't easy but we did what 
We had to  just to get results
You need to understand
Anything is possible
Don't be afraid to show who
You are and what you know
Just do your own thing 
Go ahead and find the time to
Perfect what you do in life

Freeze pauze  let
Me show y'all
Who's simply the best
It's Big Bro y'all
We always come correct 
We never go phoney
And that's what makes 
Us hot  we won't stop
We came here to school you 
Because life's an exam
You wanna pass  being
Best is crucial
Now these are just a couple of 
Words you should get used to
It ain't what you do it's how
You do what you do do

Chorus:
It ain't what you do it's
The way that you do it
It ain't what you do it's
How best you can do it
It ain't what you do it's
The time that you do it
And that's what gets results

So you want the 
Whole enchilada
Evisu and the prada
New car new house
That's more hotter
That's more money so
You've gotta work harder
And that's what gets
Results trust me
You wanna wake up
To breakfast first thing
And all them ice and
Jewels that go bling
So you gotta just put
The work in
Cause that's what gets 
Results trust me

People listen to the
Rhythm as we take control
Moving to the beat
Like never before
Click your fingers
And nod your head
Let me know that 
You're feeling this
Stop this  is what I
Hear you saying
Stop this  I'm driving you
Insane I say stop this
Music keeps the vibe when
We live it our timing
It's our way that
We're doing this

Chorus

Bridge

I'm just keeping it real
The same me like
Before the deal
Still rip up beats the
Same street appeal
Still making it hot the
Heat you can feel
People like damn Rocky
Man you need to chill
Big Brovaz blowing up
Now switch the game
Nu Flow was rowdy but
Can y'all do it again
No doubt and even better
Put the raps together
With the R&B everybody 
Telling me

So airplane airplane sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and I'll be right back at it by the end of the night  Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now  Yeah yeah somebody take me back to the days Before this was a job before I got paid Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway And back then I was rapping for the hell of it But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days Before the politics that we call the rap game And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape And back before when I tried to cover up my slang But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray So can I get a wish to end the politics And get back to the music that started this shit So here I stand and then again I say I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes  Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now  wish right now  wish right now  I could really use a wish right now I  I  I could really use a wish right now Like  like  like shootin' stars I  I  I could really use a wish right now A wish a wish right now,Airplanes,2010,Hip Hop

3059,"Tunisiano :
J'vous présente Aket le nez pointu comme une fléchette
Et vu d'profil l'équivalent de la superficie d'une raquette 
Galbé comme une baguette et un zen en acier trempé
Et son nom  il le signe à la pointe de son nez !
Aketo :
A mes cotés Tunisiano aka mâchoire d'acier 
Quand il était encore marmot les tétines ils les déchiquetaient 
Ses dents  ils se les faisaient sur n'importe quoi même du métal
C'est pour ça qu'aujourd'hui Tuni a les chicots en freestyle !
Tunisiano :
Enfoiré ! Mes chicots  ils sont comme ta tête foirée !
Abusé même accompagné tu ne rentres pas dans les soirées !
Aketo :
Tu veux parler avec ton front en 3D téma les reliefs !
Il manque plus que les lunettes qui vont avec pour un effet garanti bref !
Est-ce un homme ou un mutant ?
Tunisiano :
T'es un homme ou un pélican ?
Aketo :
T'as la stachemou à d'Artagnan !
Tunisiano :
T'es galbé comme un gars de 8 ans !
Aketo :
Attend est ce qui parait la dernière fois quand t'as mangé au restau
T'as mis la fourchette dans ta bouche et l'as broyée 
Faut pas déconner avec la pression que t'as dans la chebou.
On peut te lâcher sur un pit ou un rote et tu les chiques aux coups.
Tunisiano :
Sensationnel  la barre de pression sur chaque narine 
Vraiment un orifice respiratoire exceptionnel.
Soit mignons tu peux pas me rendre un petit service 
Les pneus de ma caisse sont dégonflés.
Tu veux pas métre un coup de pression.
Aketo :
Attention ! tu veux partir dans les Iyriques  J'vais t'allumer dans mes Iyriques.
On va t'acheter une muselière 
je vois tu grandis  tu risque de bousiller le matos.
Alors t'approche pas trop du Mic  si il finit dans t'es chicot 
Il va falloir que tu raque.
Tunisiano :
A bon  c'est comme ça  tu rentres dans des rapports de force 
Et c'est un nez ou une corne de rhinocéros.
Aketo:
Attend téma les bosses de ton front  c'est un terrain vague.
On peut faire de la bécane de crosse  on aurait dit des dunes de sable.
Tu chétou c'est agréable surtout quand t'est en chien de femme 
T'as l'impression de peloter des seins.
Moi franchement  je trouve sa malheureux.
Hé  on garde son calme  on garde son calme
Un  toi tu éteins ton portable.
Hé  je dis qu'il a match nul  il y a match nul.
Tunisan un  Aketo un  mais tout de suite 
Et bien sûr maintenant le match retour.


Tunisiano :
Aketo petit gâteau t'ès galbé comme un cerf-volant 
Dès qu'il y a un courant d'air  on te retrouve sur une terre étrangère
A la pesée vingt-trois kilos et trente centilitre de sangs.
Et le matin pour démarrer  tu t'aides d'un pace-maker.
Aketo :
Avec ta mâchoire d'homme de cromagnon
Tu fais peur aux enfants surtout esquisse pas un sourire à un sego de moins 16
Ans
En plus de ça t'as le front à Frankenstein 
t'es un vrai film d'épouvantail à toi tout seul et en plus j'te taille.
Tunisiano :
T'as un zéne tranchant  vachement bien affûté.
T'as fait la bise à une femeu  manque de peau tu l'as balafré.
Tu fais trop de bavure  alors pour limiter les dégâts 
Tu dors avec un bouchon de liège pour ne pas découper les draps.
Aketo :
Ton dentiste est poussé à bout  ça y est t'es pites son ressortis.
Il t'a confié à un vétérinaire  ta chebou est trop hard core/
Fais des films gords en plus en ce moment  il recrute a mort.
Il y a le silence des agneaux deux qui se prépare  tu ferais fort.
Tunisiano :
J'pige pas à chaque foi que tu te mouche  ton clinex se transperce.
La dernière fois que t'as éternué DESH et tombé à la renverse.
Aketo :
Attend fait voir ta bouche  il y a un chicot qui s'es chéca derrière un autre
Sa fait double dent pour mieux mastique tes proies.
Tunisiano :
J'ai dû appeler les pompiers pour qui viennent te pinter main-forte.
T'as regardé à l'oeillet  t'es resté planté à la porte.
Aketo :
Et les mecs si quelqu un cherche des pièces détachées.
Moi  j'ai un bon plan ramener des caisses 
Cet homme peut les mâchouiller en un rien de temps.
Tunisiano : Hé ouaie Aketo regarde le corps que t'as  la trompe que t'as
Aketo : Hé  moi j'te parle même pas des chicots que t'as.
Tunisiano :
Ouaie OK  tu me taille mais toi quand tu commande à boire 
T'enfile ton zéne dans le verre  on dirait que tu bois à la paille.
Aketo :
T'es allé à la piscine  ils ont dû évacuer tous les bassins.
Il y a un piranha dans la place et la Tony t'es un assassin.
Tunisiano : Franchement toi je t'estime  t'as plus de pêche qu'un ventilo 
Dés que tu te mets a respirer  on dirait qu'on a mis le clim.
À la limite c'est pratique  tu coupe même le teuteu.

We got rhyme selections in a wide array
J'ai des bons bons pour vous mangez
The party people scream oui oui  see'est vrai
'Cause I got a remote for my bidet

(Adrock)
A-d-are-o-see-k
I use the microphone like Picasso used clay
Down with freckles from around the way
Peace to Bambata and Jazzy Jay

(MCA)
I rock on the mic from here to Bombay
I give it my best and say come what may
'Cause everybody's got their dues to pay
I'm looking side ways like my man Pele

(Mike D)
Getting on like Ali boom ba yay
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray

(chorus)
Dip dip dive so socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love your in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

(Adrock)
I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBright
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap please say goodnight

(MCA)
Now here's a little something you may not like
My dj's name is Mix Master Mike
It's a real pity that you people got to bite
But I could understand because he sounds so nice

(Mike D)
Reading you the news cause I'm Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night

(Adrock)
Now who in the world do you want to fight?
It's agianst the system we should unite
Homophobics ain't alright
If you learn to love then you might love life

(chorus)

(MCA)
Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts
So many billionares while so many lack
So before the poor decide to react
Come on party people and share up your stacks

(Mike D)
Now I'm a break it down to the brass tacks
Do the Biz Mark and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch

(Adrock)
I'd like to have a say on the income tax 
Don't want to help build bombs and that's the facts
No money for health care so what's the catch?
The man got you locked with the keys to the latch

(MCA)
Mike and Adam have got my back
You bring the mics and we'll bring the raps
Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack
Don't smoke cheeba can't stand crack

3076,Have you seen a mother kiss her son goodbye ? Have you seen a dark cloud fight a silver line ? I have seen a loved one tell a million lies Karma´s like a boomerang whirling deep inside  I may not know a thing about you You may not know a thing about me But if we´re free then  [Chorus] We´re alive Take a breath because  we´re alive Take a breath  we´re alive  Put me on an airplane  let´s fly up to the sky Help me laugh with angels who just want to get me high Let´s drive down this highway and leave our fears at home  And let this twisting   winding road decide which way we go  You may not know a thing about me. I don´t know a thing about you But let´s enjoy the view  [Chorus]  Take a breath  take a deep breath Take a breath  take a deep breath  Don´t take yourself so seriously Live life for the mystery Life´s for the mystery  We may wear different clothes and pray to Gods in different robes But we´re not alone  [Chorus],Alive,1999,Hip Hop

More money  more problems  you gotta be kidding
I'd rather sit up in the Bronx and parlay some shit up
I'm usually breaking down eights and slaying some sit-ups
Boo  it's tight times  let me hustle
'Cause everything you want  I'm near with all muscle
'Cause when I'm in the streets  we eating  more Ruffles
Then we can play the suites in Vegas  all duffles
'Cause you the queen  I'm the king  be a rider
A man with a game plan stressin ain't a rider
So let me paint picture  stay crisp  we providers

3096,"So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
Daily told the people ""You can call me Your Majesty!""
Keep your battery charged
You know it won't stick  yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter
Peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (Your mother)
Don't talk about my moms  yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick  sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try
Villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly  like look at you
It's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

And you know it like a poet  like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all  she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'

When I first came out  many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide  feel the affects  scratch my name
Rahzel  now rewind that  (Gargling) slow it down  you'll find that
the way I design that  and reverb behind that  not in my contract
I'm bustin all over this bitch  while your girl cums
Down with the Two-One-Fifth  Illadelph  Dy-Nast'
are-double-O-T-S  no need to remind us
You're far behind us  tryin to high beam  blind us
Catching shinas from a nickle plated niner (Gun sounds)
Blastin' holes in your designers
This is for you primadonnas
cause my persona's like pirhannas
I got you second guessin and sweatin like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson  no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
God damn it feel good to see people up on it

1200 styles  crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my  vocabulary  vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics  I can jam like automatics
Nine millimeter  twelve rounds  one in the chamber
Russian Roulette  you can bet  there is DAN-JUR
Number five in the Billboard  with the bullet
One million  in my pile  you know the style  let me pull it
cause I'm about to blast ya  take the mic  then harrass ya
Switch up speeds  without the weed  then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine  octane  because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet  on-you-son  like I'm NASA
God damn  like to ?? compare on blaster ??

""And I'll destroy anyone  who dares go against me""

I'm Trugoy  to this rap game  I got game
Call me Denzel  with the rap name  I got aim
""He's on FIRE!!"" like a coal in a hot flame
plus my Posdonuses  produces  your prognosis
Kids doin the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death  what the doctor ordered  so say  ""Ahhh""
Take you +Three Feet High and Risin+  like De La
see'est la vie  I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP
Check the outlets for cassettes and CD
Sam Goody  Blockbustin' up your H M V
Nigga please  ask yo mamma for some cheese
Tell her need some restitution like them Vietnamese
in Vietnam  cause Rahzel drops the bomb
More complex than texts  in your Holy Qu'ran

(radio killer)

Its not a dream baby

(radio killer killer killer)

Or is it a dream

She graduated from the school of arts
Now she swimming in a pool of sharks
Roughest niggas with the coolest cars
Sophomore year had a 1st minaj
Better DC like go barrack
Girl drunk it like a Fiji and she blowed my socks
Every night she coming through for me to f*ck that
Found out she had a man I holla f*ck that
Better give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition baby girl a must have
My letters hinted on my mustache
The remy never did or did he get make a bus pass
Good dick may a chick wanna cut class
The way I'm knocking on the door they call it trespass
She my dime not the one I wanna curse at
Looking fine real diamonds on a cutglass

I'm talking authentic orgasms
Film that play it on a big plasma
Back to work just a little bit faster
She say life is a journey
I need mine just like my attorney
I get sued like a nigga switch shoes
Long money but he gotta a quick fuse
Ride slow but I'm in a quick car
Pause for a minute paint em' in a picture
Baby girl my money good
Who turned her on a nigga least kirk wood
Time to give that boy a bus pass
I see no competition girl a must have
She shines like a diamond
Motivation for morining

Green leafs in my shot glass
All night soul team had cirrock add

I'm on them hills like I'm Jonathan Kelsy
Told her friends that she felt me
We mad love through the love hate lp

It's alright with me  if it's alright with you.   Verse 1: P.S.   When I first met you  wasn't lookin' for a wife   just somebody  to keep a nigga warm in the night.   Since you was down  freakin'  we can do some meetin'    parlayin'  I got half on the boom in the trunk.   But you gotta understand girl  I'm a man girl    don't go gettin' yourself mixed up in somethin' you can't handle.   So  if it's good to you  like it's good to me   then we can kick it  but I ain't tryin' to be in no commitment.   I got too much stress dealin' with the system   and tryin' to provide a house and home for my children.   Cause women be trippin'  when they don't get no attention    and I ain't in the position    so you can't take care the loot  it's yo decision.   Chorus: Malika  P.S.   All I want to do is spend some time with you.   And all I want to do is bump 'n grind with you.   Can we get together when the time is cool?   It's alright with me  if it's alright with you.   Verse 2: Malika   Talk for a minute  but don't wear my ears out    I want some time  you want to grind  we gon have to work this out.   I never said I love you  I'm just not your hoe    and you gon have to show  you got some somethin' for a sister grow.   I want to post up twenty foreplay  Bombay    bump the O.J. sixty-nine ways.   Gotta keep it real cause there ain't no future in this.   I want to talk  you want to stick    kiss the lips  hit it quick.   I got news for you  we bout to compromise    boo  you even see the thighs  you gon have to spend   a lotta time tryin' to paperchase.   But you gon have to break me off   for that tryin' to play me off    don't mistake me to be soft.   Chorus: Malika  P.S.   All I want to do is spend some time with you.   And all I want to do is bump 'n grind with you.   Can we get together when the time is cool?   It's alright with me  if it's alright with you.   All you want to do is bump 'n grind with me.   And all you want to do is spend some time with me.   We can bump 'n grind but not for free.   Well  you better get a hustle or a j-o-b.   Verse 3: P.S.   All of a sudden want to play me like Willie Lumplover.   Ain't nothin' like a thief  I saw the game comin'.   Say you got one    three months in the oven    and you need a nigga to break you off somethin'.   But Mrs. Butterworth  tell me what it's worth    want me to play like I played in a church    but I ain't even got it  if I did I wouldn't do it.   It was cool  but let's call it a truce  and come anew.   Cause I know you ain't pregnant  that's just a weapon women sometimes   use to keep their nigga from steppin'.   Take the good with the bad and the bad with the good    I thought you understood you was f*ckin' wit a nigga from the hood.   I'm a type of man that understand your needs    but I can't pay you cause I got too many mouths to feed.   So what you want to do  you gotta let me know    cause females come quicker than the metro.   Chorus  Repeat 2X: Malika  P.S.   All I want to do is spend some time with you.   And all I want to do is bump 'n grind with you.   Can we get together when the time is cool?   It's alright with me  if it's alright with you.,All I Wanna Do,1997,Hip Hop

Now I'm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one  got two three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one hut two told them hoes take a hike
Then it's on to the next one on on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes.
I wonder if I  was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don't compare at all  no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you  now
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone  gone  gone

'Cause being your friend
Is killing me softly
Hear voices
Wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault
And the wrong time
I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausting

Don't compare at all  no
And at best all they do is distract me but now

'Cause they don't make me laugh or even cook like you
'Cause they don't photograph nah they don't sex like you
Lets face it I can't replace it
That's why all I want is you now

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Trying to celebrate my ""Independence Day"" Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kidding
Still sick real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be 
you everything that these plain bitches couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be
Lost in the player way sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway  girl you gotta a hold on me
I say I'm wrong  you say come again
Damn said I was wrong look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes 
How they coming in
Just saying
Don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
I'm praying
You ain't content with trying to do your thang
And come back baby boomerang  rang

That's why
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Sugar now that you're gone  gone  gone  gone  gone

You know that you're gone  gone  gone
I want you back",All I Want Is You,2010,Hip Hop

3171,Waiting at the door for some kind of life  You never step outside because the fears you fight  Can turn the day to night  But only in your head  And you say you're the only one that knows  Well I don't give in to that nobody but me stuff  I know where you go when you're down  That place where falling stars tear up the ground  And pace around   (All in all it's the same old thing  Float around until you get pulled in  Gather it up and we leave it behind  For someone else to see)   Take it as it comes  you take it when you want  But don't waste a fight if it doesn't feel right  But dear God don't give up  Kisses on your hand  And slaps on your face is part of life  Everybody gets their share of both  love,All in All,2001,Hip Hop

I got my gat
So you know what that means

It's a bust back thang  I ain't goin' out like a hoe
When you comin' to get me I got the four four
When you come to down me playa please don't miss
'cause that don't do nothin' but get my trigga finga pissed
If I live I live  if I die it's cool
'cause I know for sure when I was here that I was a fool
If you gone drill me come on and drill me
It's all good 'cause I got some people to see
While I'm here I'm gettin' full all the time gettin' blunted
My company on the move we bought the benz 500
A.K.'s and glocks  in the back the Lexus jeeps
Havin' big baller parties every other week
This is the clique nigga 2-2-6
Black Connection nigga again the code is 2-2-6
Droppin' dope hits  takin' a nigga bitch
While you're on that flight  I'm bustin' nuts in your wife
All assault rifles  the weapons that's on my team
S.K's  A.K's  M-1's and car beams
Fulfillin' dreams  goin' to the top nigga
Don't playa hate 'cause we'll still hit'cha block nigga
Baby Gangsta ain't nothin' nice
A young nigga trigga happy that'll put it in your life
I ain't right  represent Uptown to the fullest
Finger on the trigga and I'm ready to pull it

Chorus:
Got my finger on the trigga  what'cha gone do?
What'cha gone do? Nigga that's All On you
Got my finger on the trigga  what'cha gone do?
What'cha gone do? Nigga that's All On you
Got my finger on the trigga  what'cha gone do?
Uptown on the way  Bitch so let us through
Got my finger on the trigga  what'cha gone do?
Downtown get out the way 'cause that's All On you

You could  take it how you wanna  bring it how you feel
My niggas is conscienceless and we kill or be killed
F*ck doin' drive-bys man we do a pull up
The nigga on the passenger side automatically die
From several gunshot wounds to the head
On the scene he dead Chopper City niggas fled
Won't you listen to Ziggy get your car doors bullet proof
It's rainin' choppers so get a bullet proof roof too
You got yay? I don't know it nigga
Nine-six you gettin' nabbed so you best not show it nigga
'cause that's when you blow it nigga
Your door get kicked in  we want your yay
High powered AK  false move and your face no trace
Beat the case  go to the weight
Make sure it ain't a fake
I want your nameplate  cash  and your Versace shoes
If you stingy gettin' plucked nigga that's All On you

Chorus

Street shit is what I'm into
You got it I'm comin' to get you
Don't hesitate nigga or the B.G. gone have to split you
I'm down for whatever I'm a ass with that chopper
If you playin' with me then them fifty shots gone stop ya
No bullshittin' nigga my dream is to make a mil
Paper chasin' ain't no fakin' playa haters get killed
Young trill Baby Gangsta into pimpin' them hoes
But before I trick the hoes my money goes to my nose
And fat opthimals  T-shirts and Girbauds
Solja Reeboks straight stickin' to the G-code
Uptown is the home of the car-jackers
Robbers  gangsta rappers  headsplitters and kidnappers
Better than seed  is the way I shop for that D
Not the 17th  the real niggas in that 3
Play wit em  hard head niggas they split em
Raw dope they sell it  I get it I can tell it
How it go  back up or get banged nigga
Street smarts the game nigga
Gotta let em hang nigga
Pussy nigga got beef wit the night creepers
Me  brotha and Diesel ridin' with them street sweepers
Old nigga wanna slang  without a clique?
He don't wanna share  so we gone ride on that bitch
We bout to turn your block to a war zone
I'm warning you to bring the little kids in they home
'cause when we spin the bin bullets just get to spit
I gave you fair warning so if you hit you hit
'cause I ain't slackin' when I do what I gotta do
Stop bein' nosey Bitch  but that's All On you

Up and down like she gots.. (hydrolics)

Noooo
You can't the one and only
I only want you to have fun with the homies
Homies  we take them up out the arena
Back and forth like Venus and Sirena
Seen her?.. (have you seen her?)
Ya know my M.O.
Are dot DiVoe  everything's a go  oh
Wait  before I lose that number
Somebody in the crew might want to talk to her

Ayo
I see you starin' in my face
You look real sexual
I like the way you move
Girl ya makin' me want to
If you like  we can change the scene
And go somewhere with me
Ya body's callin' me
You already know what I wanna do

40 rich  40 chicks in the mix
How freaky can shorty get
Domino effect  one by one  they all go down
I'll be done by the sun... up
I got stamina
If I can't then my man can handle her
We don't hide'em  we just divide'em
You need? we got'em
Here we'll provide'em
I don't love'er  never handcuff'er
Only if she like that  then I get rough with'er
'cause I can do it anyway you like
Only catch is you can't stay the night
Wake up  fix your hair and your make-up
We make a good couple but now we gotta break-up
B.I.V.I.N. rep N.E. Bad Boy now
This sound is B.B.D.

The party's in my place
Chicks all in the pool
Ecstacy in the air
As I exit out with you
Tearin' off my shirt
Unbucklin' my belt
Tossin' bottoms up
Now I got you fallin' in love

Alcohol
Half naked women is the life that I'm livin'  my
Head's spinnin'  the clock strikes five
(Yo how many girls can you fit in that ride?)
I don't know  the outfits will help me decide
(Why)
Less is more  and the more the merrier
Hurry up  the next stop  the Marriot
Tear her belly out while smearin' her mascara up
Poof  then its back on the bus
She never knew we checked out 'til they're wakin' her up
Don't blame me  better blame the one raisin' her up
""Look  that's not my daughter on that cam-corder"" (nu-uh)
I'm not daddy  even though she call me that  you know me
I don't call'em back  I'll catch you at the next party we be at
(Ayo Blake  I don't think you would'a wanted that)

[Repeat twice]
You can... call me up if you want love
Whatever you wanna do
Get some friends  jump in the Benz
Tonight is all on you
Girl your body's  got me goin  crazy  outta control
Gotta see you outta them clothes
Tonight is all on you

3203,"There's a song that I sing
Whenever I'm sad  feelin' bad

It was a date  a simple little f*ckin' date
Or so I thought  wasn't that my great mistake?
He picked me up at eight from my crib
We went to dinner and he ordered Babyback Ribs

What a waste  a waste of the mind and body
And then he said  ""Lyte  would you like to go and party?""
I thought about it and then I said no
Pay for my food  motherf*cker and let's go

He said  ""My  aren't we aggressive?""
Damn right and I'm also perceptive
I know your kind  you roam around the f*ckin' town
You wanna slap it  flip it and rub it down

You want some booty but you're gettin' none this way
You better ask Suzy  Sally or that girl  Fay
You gets none  you hear me you cheesy rat?
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

I'm all that  yes  I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that  yes  I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

First I head out into the red eyed
Turn the AC on  so it feels cool inside
Step in the jam  baring good news
Although for some folks I bring the blues

Always solo  no relyin' on a posse
I see what you see  do you see what I see?
I see suckers  many pucker uppers
Asskissers as well as buttlickers

Many  many that will do me good and plenty
Don't know me from Adam but wanna get with me
Claimin' they will do or have done or have did me
Talkin' that yang  your ass'll get slapped
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

Ladies and gentlemen

I'm all that  yes  I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that  yes  I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

That  that

Aiyyo  milk  aiyyo  milk  this is Teddy be
Yo  I just checked out Lyte's new cut
(That  that)
And  yo  it's all that  all that
Yo  I get with you  peace

Back  way back when shit wasn't funny
I'm talkin' L Q days  your golds and your money
If you wore gold the shit was gettin' taken
Hard rocks  don't even bother fakin'

'Cause they can sense a sucker as soon as they saw ya
And oh well  how I felt sorry for the
Razor in my pocket for my protection
Blackjack in my bag for a little selection

You got beef? Bitch  chose your weapon
I sliced and diced and then I kept steppin'
For me to go for that woulda just been whack
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

I'm all that  yes  I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that  yes  I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

(That  that)
Yo  yo  Lyte  you there?
(That  that)
Alright  I just called to see if you was still shittin on wax
Yo  and don't make that shit soft  alright? Yo  pump it up
Alright  when you get in just give me a buzz

Whatchu doin' in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy? Thirteen
Thirteen? Damn  the bastards must be runnin' outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah  oh yeah  this goes out to all the families
That went through the struggle
Yeah  from the heart
It was from the heart  everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo  dwellin' in the past  flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin' through this difficult stage  I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds

But she's an old woman and due to me  I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more  we used to play ball
Eggs after school  eat grits 'cause we was poor

Grab the pliers for the channel  fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin' each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters  snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real  but the older brother still had jokes

Sadly  daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin' but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried  and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough  she just went down

Check it  fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere  cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed  two at the foot  two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon Jon  he peed the bed

Seven o'clock  pluckin' roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon  watchin' Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing  every meal was no thrill
In the summer  free lunch held us down like steel

And there was days  I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating  ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin'  I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin'  I spent stamps in stores

Mommy  where's the toilet paper  use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch  she's the neighbor
Things was deep  my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy  it killed me

But I remember this  mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin' back to face to face
I caught a case  housin' tried to throw us out of our place

Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here  why?
Yeah  yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy  I love you
Word up
It was all you  word  you brought me in like this

I sit and think about all the times we did without  yeah
I always said I wouldn't cry when I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow  I will always be around  yeah

All things that I did from this to them
Oh  from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah  you say you see the universe
Which consists of the sun  moon and star
And them planets  that exist in my space
Like man woman and child  you understand?

We got to keep it real  and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol' days
Because see  that's the child I was

What made me the man I am today
See 'cause if you forget where you come from  heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin'  aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself

So  take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again

3211,"Verse 1

I used to cry myself to sleep at night 
But that was all before he came 
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right 
But now he's here 
It's not the same 
It's not the same 
Chorus

He fills me up 
He gives me love 
More love than I've ever seen 
He's all I've got 
He's all I've got in this world 
But he's all the man that I need 
Verse 2

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes 
He takes me down 
And rocks me slow 
And in the evening when the moon is high 
He holds me close and won't let go 
He won't let go 
Chorus

All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real so feel I'm sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation
Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation
Child abuse  women loose  robbery and triple homicide
Every where this black man resides still
Check the monolouge  I'm on a 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers  do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime  the big time bowler
But any season or reason we can't take it over

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged ready war?
Known to be the smooth that sat by the door
Furthermore  for you and I to click  here's the stats
Take all that dirty money  set the wash doors and laundromats
You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot
20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot
Members only  playing pool like willie marconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street
Palled around the screen tv watching the fight
Tonight  cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect  can you dig it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missle I probe and seek  many can't critique
My physique is still solid  chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin  fool  where you been?
Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight  set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and groupies  condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand  believe it's not a game
Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Nigga you heartless
you ain't heartless
you don't want no part in this
you ain't got it in ya
I'm born to be a sinner
as I move through these evil New York streets
like grease
and some kids get caught up
all up in the crime rate
couldn't hold your nine straight when you was bustin
your whole clip and hittin nothing
your whole block on him  only two niggaz got him
came down fast
with the cash and the product
caught you pants down with ya clothes off

a nigga never knows...a nigga never knows

you got your ryhmes niggas?
bring em-we start that
its concrete combat-where I'm at
a crime covered city
where there's no time for pity
we comin from the village
of the unprivledged
blood soaked bills through murder actions
transactions all illegal
I smell the cheeb like a beagle
evil stalks and lurks
dominate and do worse in my dwelling
niggaz filling shells and compelling to bust melons
(we just) bring to these fellas

[chorus 2X]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us

these evil streets...

Verse 2:
Seen the world through the eyes of a nigga on the brink
drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
I'm trapped in these evil streets
drivin some scuffed up ragged down beat up past tims
some kid pulls up with chrome dimple guided rims
now I'm thinking its 3 in the a.m.
I'm walking and he in a BM
drop top 3-he don't even see me
would you believe  he saw my gun in 3D
10 blocks later trying to work the cd
spotted 15 on the BQE
cause ain't no way them pigs is baggin me
and up a Sonsee we official nasty

For niggas that force the issue
my man'll toss the pistol
and of course I hit you
let that loss be with you
the more L's the higher
streets are fire
make ice hearts in men
for worldly desire
its the black attack
born on the corner
nigga grew up fast to get that looter ready to shoot 'er
and he do anything to achieve it (better believe it)
grew up in a band of thieves
who retrieves the goods
stacking stacks
and pushing niggas shit back like they should
while we was gone
some shit undeveloped
now parlay  sit back
and watch armys swell up
yeah....punk niggaz

[chorus x4]
As we move through these evil streets...

Verse 3:

Only nigga that can kill me is the nigga in the mirror
but when I cup the mic and make my fighting words clearer
a nigga without a gun is like something is missing
that was my employer-when I ain't have a pot to piss in
(so listen) keep a gun  even if its not needed
better that than to have none and to be in deep shit
We mold on niggaz like Bacteria grows
fools they lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose
nigga  we kill niggaz
for Polo and Hilfigers
its all for real ill niggaz
and steel figures
ain't nothin over here
won't be soft
shit be jumping off
on the rag
don't beat me in the head with that
go head with that
I think back me in my mans rover
rip out sombodys grandmother
pulled out  the bitch ran for cover
keep niggaz guessin with our face without expressions
for niggaz stressin
I leave a lifetime impression
it shines like aggression when the flame comes out
saw the bout  what you got  when your gang runs out
shits hot  you could get burned with heat
we take turns to sleep
you better learn the street
knowledge
damn  you could get shot for 5 dollars
its live wires
with no signs of survivors...

[chorus]
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us
These evil streets iz rough
ain't no one we can trust
either roll with the rush or get rushed
cause all we got iz us

You're entangled in a great big ball of confusion
Trapped in a world that is just an illusion
You're thinking it's real but that's not what's happening
Well we're here to let you know the real deal
(That's why we're rappin')
(Yo)Life's just a game one great big riddle
And we're all wrapped up smack dab in the middle
Play the Lotto everyday in hopes you're gonna win it
But it's just another game and you're wrapped up in it
You haven't won it yet but you ain't had enough
'Cause you know it like a poet you're (all wrapped up)

All wrapped up(x2)

We're gonna rap about the game that people are playin'
(Yo)If you're ready just listen to what I'm sayin'
Talking about homeboys and the fly young ladies
Men woman sons daughters and the little-bitty babies
Speaking on the def jams everybody's be-bopping
Super stupid cold chillin' and the party is rockin'
Soap opera in the day got the ladies cold illin'
""One life to live""(you know it) and "" All my chillin'""
You know you gotta have it too much ain't enough
Because the fact of the matter is you're all wrapped up

All wrapped up (x2)

Doctors wrapped up in the ill and the sick
We got wrapped up in politics
Some wrapped up in living long
(And you're)All wrapped up in the beat of his song
Gamblers wrapped up in making bets
And the lovers wrapped up in this game called sex
(Now trouble's)Out there and it won't ignore ya
Don't look for any trouble it'll surely look for ya
If you try to play tough then it's just your luck
That it'll call your bluff and then trouble's gotcha all wrapped up

All wrapped up (x2)

You're seen hanging on the corner nine days a week
(You gonna blow)You don't know you're wrapped up in the streets
Sporting 50-dollar sneakers and all the money's spent
While Mom's (all wrapped up) Trying to pay rent
We got the weekeng girls and all you fly guys
Wrapped up in a world of 9-to-5
We got the sly slick and wicked ain't it funny
(Yo)How they're (all wrapped up) Cold trying to take money
If you get it you're with it (If) You don't that's tough
And you know the real reason is you're

Like Luke I am your father
Only if you wanna  take a dip in each other waters
Take this bedroom and turn it into a sauna

I wanna handle my shit  but it hasn't occurred
I need the stamina  keep on like my grandmama
When I'm not on camera I gotta be a man of my word
And be a greater guy  not some thin-as-paper guy
Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl
And made her cry  saying  see ya later  bye
Shit I say is pretty strange
Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
F*ck it  man  we're changing too  look at what we going through
Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into
But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape 
A great tsunami wave of cotton that I'm caught in
That she bought at Ross—I know the cost of it was probably awesome
But my style is sorta sloppy
I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy
The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley
And I don't really know why  no I don't really know why

All you can do  is
All you can do  is
All you can do  is
All you can do  is

So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out
But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route
But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse
I tried to join the 27 Club  they kicked me out
It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out
And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in
She's all like  ""come on Joplin  who the f*ck invited him?!
Hide all of the Heinekens!"" No  they don't know my name
My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain
And Jimmy Morrison the doors  and Brian Jones  you know  the Stones
Are joking  toking on a roach playing a poker game
I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster
Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain
They're playing Purple Rain  or maybe Purple Haze
And Kurt says  ""How the f*ck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?""
I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey
But I hit the earth and break a mothaf*cka's vertebrate (hey)
I guess I'm f*cking up the blueprint for success
Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest
This recklessness  no common senses
I Kamikaze  there's consequences
I don't condone it  but I did it  I'ma own it
I've been living for the moment gotta go (go!)

Ich gähne  kneif mich selbst  blauer Fleck  der Zehnte Für 'n Tapetenwechsel ewig gebraucht  Leg mich auf die bequemste Couch  die Ikea verkauft Und guck mal ich habe 'ne Matratze im Bett Und mein Hund endlich Futter im Napf  das ihm schmeckt Endlich seh' ich meinen Dad und meine Schwester mal wieder Ich hab Geld für Benzin  1  60 pro Liter Doch ich traue mich jetzt noch nicht loszufahren Blauer Fleck Nummer elf auf dem Oberarm  (Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch Unglaublich  kein Ruß  Blütenstaub (denn alles) sorgenfrei  unbekannt Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an  Nun hat sich doch alles zum Positiven gewendet Denn nach so langer Zeit im Abseits waren Liebe und Vertrauen Gefühle  die ich nicht mehr kannte Drei Jahre lang ging ich durch's Leben wie ein Schlafwandler Dann bin ich aufgewacht und entdeckte die Welt für mich neu Dabei alle  wirklich alle falschen Freunde und schlechte Menschen  Gegen die guten getauscht Mein Gott das war nicht immer leicht  Aber jetzt kann ich endlich wieder auf mein Herz hören Ich bin glücklich Überglücklich Und ich danke all jenen  die mein Leben etwas besser gemacht haben Schöner gemacht haben und ein Teil dieses Albums waren Chakuza Magnolia,Alles Gut,2013,Hip Hop

3239,"Ich spreche heute Klartext  Alpa Gun der Punisher
Mach mir kein' auf hart  wenn wenn du draußen läufst mit Bodyguards
Alles kommt zurück  Caney  vierte Platte und ich fliege
Ich bin jetzt erwachsen und hab keine Zeit für Rumgespiele
Ich musste viel zu oft bemerken  dass ihr mich nur bremst
Caney  Vertrauen ist ein Wort  an dem du dich verbrennst
Manchmal wird es richtig eng und du musst bemerken
Wie die meisten Menschen dich nicht kenn'  Bruder  ja  so ist der Mensch
Ich kenn' das alles  also laber mich nicht zu
Ich war geradezu verflucht  denn mein Karma war nie gut  Caney
Alles kommt zurück und genauso tu' ich's heute auch
So viele Falsche Brüder nutzten meine Träume aus
Ich geh' mein Weg und hoffe  dass der Neid im Keim erstickt
Wenn Alper Abi redet  haben deutsche Rapper Schweigepflicht
Guck  alles kommt zurück  die guten und die schlechten Taten
Am jüngsten Tag muss hier jeder seine Rechnung zahlen

Ihr wart nie fair zu mir  ihr wolltet  dass ich nichts erreiche
Ihr habt eine Konkurrenz in mir gesehen und hattet Schiss
Ich brauche niemanden von euch  ich mach das jetzt alleine
Heute könnt ihr lachen  aber glaub mir  alles kommt zurück
Ich war naiv  doch mein Herz ist immer noch im Reinen
Ihr habt mir zwar nichts gegönnt  doch ich wünsche euch allen Glück
Ich brauche niemanden von euch  ich mach das ganz alleine
Heute macht ihr Faxen  aber glaubt mir  alles kommt zurück

Yeah ich hör' wie manche sagen  Alpa wäre tot
Wenn ich so wie damals wär  ging ich gewaltsam auf sie los 
Caney  alles kommt zurück  nein  ich wollte nie dein' Tuareg
Junge  guck dich heute um und sag  wer ist dein Bruder jetzt?
Die Leute könn' es nicht verstehen  die Dinge so wie ich zu sehen
Ihr haltet euch für Stars  aber habt bis heute nix bewegt
Ich kann sehen  wie deutsche Rapper Frust auf diesen Typen schieben
Weil ich zu viel Einblick in alle eure Lügen biete
Alpa Gun der Escobar  Ghettostar  rapp' brutal
Und all die Verräter da draußen  sie müssen jetzt bezahlen
Ich hab eine Rechnung da  die vor mir unterschrieben ist
Und heute geh ich erst  wenn ich von jedem meine Miete krieg'
Ging es nach euch  wär' bei mir gar nix los  mann ihr seid so schadenfroh
Aber dafür ist oben die Strafe hoch
Guck  alles kommt zurück  die guten und die schlechten Taten
Am jüngsten Tag muss hier jeder seine Rechnung zahlen

Ihr wart nie fair zu mir  ihr wolltet  dass ich nichts erreiche
Ihr habt eine Konkurrenz in mir gesehen und hattet Schiss
Ich brauche niemanden von euch  ich mach das jetzt alleine
Heute könnt ihr lachen  aber glaub mir  alles kommt zurück
Ich war naiv  doch mein Herz ist immer noch im Reinen
Ihr habt mir zwar nichts gegönnt  doch ich wünsche euch allen Glück
Ich brauche niemanden von euch  ich mach das ganz alleine
Heute macht ihr Faxen  aber glaubt mir  alles kommt zurück

Yeah yeah ich habe alle eure ganzen Spielchen mitgemacht
Aber nur dank eurem Neid hat bis heute nichts geklappt
Caney  jetzt ist Schicht im Schacht  alles kommt zurück
Alpa rastet richtig aus und macht aus diesen Rappern Şiş Kebap
Ich bin ein ganz normaler Typ  der seine Rechte will
Aufgewachsen in Berlin  mein Leben war ein Actionfilm
Ihr habt viel geredet über Alpa und sei'm Lebenslauf
Alles kommt zurück ist eine Quittung  die die Szene braucht

Ihr wart nie fair zu mir  ihr wolltet  dass ich nichts erreiche
Ihr habt eine Konkurrenz in mir gesehen und hattet Schiss
Ich brauche niemanden von euch  ich mach das jetzt alleine
Heute könnt ihr lachen  aber glaub mir  alles kommt zurück
Ich war naiv  doch mein Herz ist immer noch im Reinen
Ihr habt mir zwar nichts gegönnt  doch ich wünsche euch allen Glück
Ich brauche niemanden von euch  ich mach das ganz alleine

3241,Yeah  Dieses Leben ist nicht immer dankbar Nein  dieses Leben ist nicht immer leicht Und manchmal denkst du  du bist ganz allein Und du begreifst nun  dass jeder auf dich scheißt Und du lässt jetzt deine Tränen raus und weinst Jeder versucht dir deine Träume auszureden Weil sie hoffen  dass du anfängst aufzugeben Und du fragst dich wann hört er bloß auf  der Regen? Können sie's einfach nicht lassen  auf dich drauf zu treten? Du spürst die Blicke und du weißt du bist hier nicht willkommen Hier nicht willkommen Weil du hier keine Liebe bekommst  dieser Beton Nennt sich „Leben“  Junge  und das sind Kopfschmerzen Und dieser Kopfschmerz lässt dich in 'nem Loch sterben Und keiner antwortet dir Ich bin wie du und du wie ich  es gibt eine Handvoll wie wir Denn morgen ist ein neuer Tag Hör auf dein Herz und versuch's Aber glaub mir: alles wird gut  Und wenn sie meinen du stehst nie wieder auf  dann lass sie reden Junge  zeig ihnen das ist dein Traum  du wirst ihn leben Und beweis diesen Leuten  die niemals an dich geglaubt haben Das  was sie haben  kannst du auch haben Denn wenn sie meinen  du hast hier nix verloren  dann zeig es ihnen Zeig es allen  keiner hält dich mehr auf  komm  lass dich fallen Heb den Kopf und blick einfach nach vorn und jetzt versuch's Ich sag'  versuch's! Alles wird gut!  Alles wird gut  Mann  du schaffst das schon Du bist den Neid und den Hass gewohnt Aber du hast Herz  wann wird das belohnt? Und dieser Weg ist ein verdammtes Labyrinth Du hast Träume  obwohl Schlafwandeln dir nix bringt Hör auf dein' Instinkt  hör nicht auf die Leute  die reden Denn du siehst selbst  dass deine Freunde hier stehen Sei deinen Freunden nah  doch deinen Feinden noch näher Vergessen ist einfach  doch verzeihen ist schwerer Bleib wie du bist  auch wenn sie sagen  dass du nix bist Mach es für dich  glaub mir  Mann  sonst packst du es nicht Und packst du es nicht  ja  dann scheißen alle auf dich Dann bist du alles und nix und vor allem ein Witz Lass dich nicht runterziehen  lass dich nicht unterkriegen Sie haben das gleiche Ziel  sind selber unzufrieden Auch wenn es hart ist Wir werden alle Helden sein Auch wenn es nur für ein' Tag ist  yeah!  Und wenn sie meinen du stehst nie wieder auf  dann lass sie reden Junge  zeig ihnen das ist dein Traum  du wirst ihn leben Und beweis diesen Leuten  die niemals an dich geglaubt haben Das  was sie haben  kannst du auch haben Denn wenn sie meinen  du hast hier nix verloren  dann zeig es ihnen Zeig es allen  keiner hält dich mehr auf  komm  lass dich fallen Heb den Kopf und blick einfach nach vorn und jetzt versuch's Ich sag'  versuch's! Alles wird gut!  Und bist du unten  drücken sie dich noch ein Stück tiefer Noch ein Stück tiefer  noch ein Stück tiefer Steh  steh jetzt auf und zeig ihnen wer du bist  denn Bist du erst weg  dann weint keiner mehr um dich Und bist du unten  drücken sie dich noch ein Stück tiefer Noch ein Stück tiefer  noch ein Stück tiefer Steh  steh jetzt auf und zeig ihnen wer du bist  denn Bist du erst weg  dann weint keiner mehr um dich  Und wenn sie meinen du stehst nie wieder auf  dann lass sie reden Junge  zeig ihnen das ist dein Traum  du wirst ihn leben Und beweis diesen Leuten  die niemals an dich geglaubt haben Das  was sie haben  kannst du auch haben Denn wenn sie meinen  du hast hier nix verloren  dann zeig es ihnen Zeig es allen  keiner hält dich mehr auf  komm  lass dich fallen Heb den Kopf und blick einfach nach vorn und jetzt versuch's Ich sag'  versuch's!

Cause I'm so fly

I'm supa dupa fly
You can call my missy's boo
Pull up in the SLR
Have all the mammals sick of you
All them college credits
You can throw them things away
You ain't gonna be needin' a job
You f*ckin' with Jose
Hey hello hello aloha
I go hard
I'm so fly
We so hot
They so not
Them other niggas is lame
Seened you on the sidelines time to put you in the game
Coca be the name
Parties up in Diddys house
Push them through the door say show em what the city about
Touch a couple blocks got the dough and skate off
And just like Bernie me and my baby made-off

Put the mic down I'm on now don't needa bake a shish
Or you can find me on the charts
Or up in St. Broads racin' European cars
Speedin' pass the law hit my baby mama raw
And she my baby mama 'cause them other chickens flaw

I'm such a shopaholic
What you know it ain't trickin 'if you really got it
Louis scarfs  Louis frames  Louis chucks

And you ain't got nothin' for us
Millions from tourin' and the crib ain't gotta mortgage

3266,"The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac  See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride  ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool  cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me  with the braids  the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan  can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph  I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause  I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side  we only live this that
love us back right.

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast  cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews  then we step to school
Step from School  back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris  I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack  I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac  Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because
A nigga sold a couple of mil
Look here
You can't say nothing if you're last in the line
So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind
And it's Alright",Alright,1993,Hip Hop

Thirty racks on magnum bottles  I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus  fresh I'm out that corner store

Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha'd  some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full

It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beatbox
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book  hear it how you want it

Consume weed and drink brew 'til we perfume the room

3305,"Yeah! and I've set up and turned out this state
With my own two hands
We've traveled this land packed tight in minivans
And all this for the fans  girls  money  and fame

I play their game  and then they scream my name
I will show no shame  I live and die for this
If I come off soft  then chew on this
Are you scared?

Devil without cause  and I'm back
With the Beaver hat and Ben Davis slacks
30-pack of Stroh's  30-pack of hoes
No rogaine in the propane flows

Chosen one  I'm the living proof
With the gift of gab from the city of truth
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back
And I did not stutter

When I said that I'm goin platinum  sellin rhymes
I went platinum  seven times
And still they ill they want to see us fry
I guess because of only God knows why why why why why

Oh  they call me cowboy  I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air  let me see where you're at
And say hey  hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey  hey
I'm giving back so say hey  hey
Show me some metal and say hey  hey  hey  hey

I like AC/DC and ZZ Top
Bocephus  Beasties  and the Kings of Rock
Skynyrd  Seger  Limp  Korn  the Stones
David Allen Coe  and No Show Jones

Yeah! Pass that bottle around
Got the rock from Detroit and soul from Motown
The underground stoned f*ckin pimp
With tracks that mack and slap back the whack

Never get in the way  I don't play with with that
But watch me rock with Liberace flash
Punk rock the Clash  Boy Bands are trash
I like Johnny Cash and Grandmaster Flash

Oh  they call me cowboy  I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air  let me see where you're at
And say hey  hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey  hey
I'm giving back so say hey  hey
Show me some metal and say hey  hey  hey  hey

Yeah  I saw your band
Jumping around on stage like a bunch of wounded ducks
When you gunna learn sucker?
You just can't f*ck with Twisted Brown
Trucker

I'm an American Bad Ass
Watch me kick  you can roll with Rock
Or you can suck my dick
I'm a porno flick  I'm like Amazing Grace

I'm gunna f*ck some hoes after I rock this place
Superfly living doublewide
Side car on my Glide so Joe see can ride
Full sack to share  bringin' flash and flair

Got the long hair swinging  middle finger in the air
Snake skin suits  65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell  so if you do

Give the next generation a big 'f*ck you'
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma
Said f*ck high school  pissed on my diploma
Smell the aroma  check my hits
I know it stinks in here  cause I'm the Shit

Oh  they call me cowboy  I'm the singer in black

The way I'm talkin I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'cause if you is or you ain't a gang banger
Keep one in the chamber
'cause you'll get them things put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?

To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest

I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit  jack

I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet

So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress

Crack the safe  got the money and the jewelry

Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in a dig  yo it couldn't be
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out  I gotta get the f*ck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin' the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope

3318,"As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land  I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at a discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care  in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude?
You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree
I really look good in black fool
If you come to visit  you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint  so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone  no lights  no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Caruso
It's as primitive as can be

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish Paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish Paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish Paradise
We don't fight  we all play nice
Living in an Amish Paradise

Hitchin' up the buggy  churnin' lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday  soon I'll raise anutter
Think you're really righteous?
Think you're pure in heart?
Well  I know I'm a million time as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes want to be like
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else  my brother  I might have to get medieval on your heinie

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish Paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish Paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Living in an Amish Paradise
But you'd probably think it bites

Mai lascerÃ² che qualcuno ci divida e se al mio fianco ti avrÃ² accetterÃ² ogni sfida amor de mi vida sei il mio angelo fammi da guida. I guai che ti ho creato che ho combinato essendo stato messo a questo mondo e non essendone abilitato ti ho dato un gran da fare senza contare la voglia di non studiare da quando all'asilo non volevo che mi lasciassi a quando nei compiti volevo che mi aiutassi che mi guidassi quando i miei amici erano scomparsi che in 'sto casino sapessi muovere i passi mi hai insegnato a stare in piedi e ad incassare i colpi anche se in alcuni casi ne uscimmo stravolti tu mi eri sempre a fianco le notti che ero malato passate in bianco e ripensandoci in questo tuo dare hai dei rimpianti quali sono stati i prezzi da pagare e se di me ora voglio renderti orgogliosa Ã¨ perchÃ¨ so che per me hai rinunciato ad ogni cosa. Mai lascerÃ² che qualcuno ci divida e se al mio fianco ti avrÃ² accetterÃ² ogni sfida amor de mi vida sei il mio angelo fammi da guida. VentitrÃ¨ anni suonati forse sono indipendente senza te forse sono autosufficiente Ã¨ grazie a te se di questa vita gusto ogni sorso colgo il succo di ogni discorso se riuscirÃ² a stare in piedi da solo Ã¨ perchÃ¨ godrÃ² di ogni tua cosa che ho ogni tua dote oh  mi amor se soffro so giÃ  che soffri se sto bene so giÃ  che tu te ne accorgi piena di attenzione si dolci nei miei confronti ti voglio bene mamma vivi nei miei mondi nei sogni piÃ¹ profondi consapevole di ogni tuo miracolo di troppe bugie colpevole ma ogni ostacolo posso superare con ogni consiglio che mi sai dare e se ti avrÃ² sempre vicino li affronterÃ².

No soy ni mas ni menos  Arriba!!  Lucha por lo tuyo  Arriba!  Dime lo que piensas  Arriba!  Dame lo mejor de ti yo te doy lo mejor de mi  Me meto pues  Si me muero enciéndeme una vela  Que me enfrió te hago una candela   Lo mas importante no lo enseñan en la escuela  La medalla esta al final de la escalera  Podéis intentar convencerme yo sigo arriba! No olvido su conveniencia  Por supuesto mi tripa esta en Sevilla  Por poco que tenga lo pongo en la parrilla  Como te lo va hacer como te lo hacia eh la Mala Maria  Con lo que tu lo amabas y el que no te quería  La vida da mas vueltas de eso estoy convencida   Y que nada me falta  Se que alguien vendría  Pon eso ahí que será un día  Mis hijos y tus hijos lo verían  Pon eso ahí que será un día  Y si me muero enciéndeme una vela  Que me enfrió te hago una candela  Lo mas importante no lo enseñan en la escuela  La medalla esta al final de la escalera,Amor y Respeto,2003,Hip Hop

Amusement park F 50 [Incomprehensible]  G Unit

Shorty you ain't gotta take ya panties off
Just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby  come on and ride

It go up and down and 'round and 'round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight  I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

Good evening ladies  I tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you

Some rides go fast some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high  hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away we be startin' a family

It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl  you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat

Applause now that's the first half of my act
Started out a pimp now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper just don't f*ck with my stacks
(Oh  it's like that?)
Yeah  it's like that

Shorty you ain't gotta take ya panties off
Just pull em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride

It go up and down and 'round and 'round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

Now  you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosives  it's all in the hotel
Put me to the test girl  I don't fail
I'll work it out without a doubt

there's plenty water rides I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your luster's seduction considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle  I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like you know  I don't care

I really want to thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer my dear

So watch everything that you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that  lick that  swallow that lollipop
Forget that  grip that  ride it nonstop

Shorty you ain't gotta take ya panties off
Just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby come on and ride

It go up and down and 'round and 'round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight  I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

3339,"It's Tek man niggaz can't tell me shit

[Tek]
I do what I do like I do for the hood
Pop tools pop jewels burn backwoods
Slay dj's who think they untouchable
Renegade never been afraid MC's get it too
The moral of the story is this
I used to say get off but this time
Suck my dick!
I'm from BK home of Big and Aaliyah
Watch how the pound of the four-fifth leave ya

[Sean Price]
I guess I'm back where I started
Open up for Buckshot and just rappin retarded
I hate the life that I'm livin I need it
Don't believe me ask my wife and my children
See I'm back on the street packin the heat
Royalty checks equal to crack in the street
Niggaz like f*ck crack Ruck rap to the beat
I'm aight I'll be back week listen
From day one I had bad start
To eat moms stole meat out the path mart
I ain't playin I went from the prey to the street
To blazin heat to blazin heat to haze in street
Did a couple of months and came home
Thought about what I did
Did the same shit I ain't come back home
Niggaz like ""why you done that homes?""
""I don't know (shit..f*ck)..I don't know""

[Buckshot]
The saga continues the motherf*ckin drama continues
Buck brought bomb to ya interview and blew the main
topic
what's up with boot camp clik son?
They ain't knockin they ain't hot in
Ain't droppin the now topics
But listen nigga this is how I pop shit
I don't mean Moet corks when the poet talks
Every line leave ya blind when the mind get lost
Rhymes are enforced with action
Cause everybody looking like
Is they slackin  are they back in what's crackin?
Nigga I'm hip hop like the backspinnen
Never change the fact that I did back then

[Steele]
Way before this all began
Back when I wasn't rappin
I was scrappin for ends
Stop crime started rhymin
Knapsack and my tims
Chart climbin y'all kind can get a ghat to ya ribs
There's a thin between what I rep and I live
When you violate mine I'm getting back at you kid
Don't let it get to the gun clappin and shit
Plastic wrap back smack you in the back of ya wig
I  make it so you won't get back to ya crib
Break ya wrist  never scratch you never wreck it again
Take a risk never steal from Steele and Tek again
Take the fifth  cock the hammer let it rest on ya chin
My dudes destine to win
F*ck ya thoughts
want to brawl dog my team the sports
And so ya thinking I'm ""The One"" like Jet Li
Test me Steele will leave you resting

[Top Dog]
I can't take this
Blood boiling pressure rising
Open my eye's an we narrowed down to 7 guys
And so you ask about the god DO
I'm top notch holdin my spot gun by my crotch
You think not I'm respected and feared around here
And so I must prepared around here
You know everything that glitters ain't gold
You ho getting pimped by niggaz you don't know
That's whoa  watch out for cars that move slow
Windows low
I was taught by the best to do the one
And gain control of this game
And be sold not told And So
I'ma rep for be	-O-O-T see-A-M-P
Cause I'm Top D-O-G number 3
You know from the O.G.C.
That blow trees f*ckin with them Cocoa be	's
We OD's f*ckin with them Cocoa be	's

[Buckshot]  
F*ck everything you been told
Shit like Buck ain't never went gold
He never have a platinum hit
He on that underground backpack rappin shit

[Tek]
If you for real than you know the deal

[Steele]
I do or I die and I never ran never will

Words that get niggaz locked up in 73rd

Arriba  abajo  por todos lados
Armando el desmadre como mi compadre
Que no tiene tiempo para agüaitarse
Siempre que tiene humor ya sea me tomo una cerveza
Para animarse y así alterarse
Un poco de sabor  amargo el trago
Hay que olvidar todos los pinches ratos
Con un poco de desmadre y todos bien armados
Despertando al vecino y a todo el vecindario
Hasta ver que amanece y ya no haya cheve
Hasta que dejes de oír (zumbando al machete)

Andamos armados

Somos lo que somos  aunque no comprendes
Unos mexicanos que controlan el machete
Mira como sube más
Esta pinche fiesta es pa' todo el personal
La raza  sigue uniendo vecindarios
Venimos armados mirando a todos lados
Siempre que querramos  haremos a un lado
A cualquier mamila que pretenda atañarnos
Como algunos homies nado en mi mente
Zumba el machete  sale el demente
Mira como sube más
Duro para arriba que no vaya a bajar

Andamos armados

Andamos armados con el micrófono y el ritmo
(Todo este pinche ruido)
El machete controlando todo el escenario
(Con la cheve en la mano y el desmán organizado)

Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras

Andamos armados con el cuerno de chivo
A ver quien se atreve a apagar el pinche ruido
El desmadre organizado no es sólo un rato
Es pa' toda la noche (tu trépale al radio)
Si a tí te parece súbele al volumen
Agárrate una cheve a ver a quien se le sube
El primer balazo es al aire pa' alegrar la fiesta
Si todo si es más fiel que se entrometa
Pa' que me detenga no va a ser sencillo
Esto está empezando sinó ya vale un grillo
Si no vas a unirte  ni pa' que te metes
Hazte a un lado  que ahí te va el machete

Andamos armados

Andamos armados con el micrófono y el ritmo
(Todo este pinche ruido)
El machete controlando todo el escenario
(Con la cheve en la mano y el desmadre organizado)

Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan
Hazlo a tu modo con lo que tu quieras
Ármense todos  todos los que puedan

3347,"Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Who set me free
My heart is without a home
I don't want to be alone
Gotta find me an angel
In my life

Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I learn
That I need somebody so
Still I'll just go on
Hoping that I'll find someone

Gotta find me an angel in my life

I know there must be someone  someone for me
I've lived too long without the love of someone
And there's no misery  like the misery I feel in me

Gotta find me an angel in my life
She'll be there  now don't you worry
Keep looking now just keep looking",Angel,1996,Hip Hop

And now I got to let her go and pray she comes back to me

3351,"Now you've been up and you've been down
Stayed strong even though daddy wasn't around
My momma through the thick and the thin beginning to end
And though I be sinning you keep me livin' with that love that you givin'
It's unconditional hey the sun shines when I see a smile on ya face
My momma with the money and jewels the record and tours
I'd give it away if I could make your days happy days
And when my hearts broke and can't cope I'm comin' on home
To remember the reason why I was born
Cuddle up inside your heavenly arms you help me weather the storm
You love music so I put it in song

She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an Angel workin' on me
She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an Angel workin' on me

I wasn't born wild you know you raised me right
But the roads of Alabama called me into the night
From the coke and the weed and extacy
I'm lost in the streets but you still remain next to me
The blood that I bleed it flows through your veins
Even in my lowest point I can still hear your words to my brain
First time I was arrested mommas love was tested
I couldn't contest it so here's my confession you're my blessing
You're the reason I believe you're the reason I sing
You're the reason angels tangle me in heavenly things
It's been a long road so hard and cold
But you keepin' me warm with your heart of gold

She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an Angel workin' on me
She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an
Angel workin' on me

You're the light at the end of the tunnel the break of the day
After the darkest night chasing all the evil away
You're my flowers and sunshine cherries and red wine
Diamonds they can't find shining through hard times
You're the angel on Earth the proof there's a God
The reason to keep on going you're my light in the dark
The first star in the sky and the last to leave
And when I'm travelin' through the night I feel your light on me

She's an Angel workin' on me
She's an Angel workin' on God's train
She's an Angel workin' on me",Angel,2005,Hip Hop

Left without a word and nothing to say
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you  no
So I asked God

God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there is something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries

God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat  I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now
But you can't have it

Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Auto fatigued then fatigue the enemy
Look man you wanna see me locked up  shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket screamin' bastard
Cryin'  know my friends is lyin'
I know who killed em' filled em
With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts
Dyin' aint the s***
But it's pleasant kinda quiet
Watch my n****s bring the riot

Came from the heavens just to sing a song for you
To the rhythm of my love for you 
And now it's beating slow  and you know
This the end of the road when I sing this slow song for you you
And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go 
I don't know  you can hear them callin  don't you 
When the angels call like

Yo
If you don't wanna stay you can goo
But since love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low 
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)

When the angels call like (i answer)

Calling  for you  I will tell the angels now
Let them turn back in to stone
I do  love you  it's true
Fire  climbing
We ignore the angels call
They were warnings after all
It's cool  if I  pick you

Freaky  fre-fre-fresh

Woof  I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal
I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal
I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal
I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal

How you just gon' back me up and I'm 2 dollars from bein' rich
You oughta be grateful a nigga like me even see you bitch
I was thinkin' about rockin' Arribas  but the gators look nice
Nigga was talkin' about they was comin' out like players tonight

They won't let me in with my pistol  I'm okay with the knife-a
Anything I can get my hands on when the fight starts
Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand  by the right bar
Get the wife and she could [Incomprehensible] light stars

She ain't stupid  she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records  play the songs for the kids
For instance  I can come through bouncin' in this bitch like what
And she's figured this shit  she ready to give that life up

Wonderin' how do it feel to be with G's like us
Be in a better situation than that all night bus
You're wild hoe be f*ckin' up my G's
You better get back  I spent six and a quarter for these  ya hear me?

I see you watchin' how the boy comes to Grover
And you wanna overthrown him  knock him off his throne
Your potnahs rockin' with you 'til they find out who it is
Then they gon' try to convince y'all to leave it alone

I'm here to sabotage what enemies accomplish
They're not about the camouflage  the homies that I ride with
I keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
I don't vouch for nobody  I just make sure I pay homage

Hey shorty  this nigga here's a vet like Shaq
I don't have to control the ball but I control that rap
If I smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back
They like it when a gangster take control like that

She feels protected when she in that Lexus
Givin me head  got me takin' all wrong exits
I'm not the people you should be upset with
I don't mean no harm baby and I'm not sexist

Woof  I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal
I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal
Woof  I'm a animal  yes  I am a animal

A gangsta still fightin' charges but he totes that glock
Like a junkie with a pipe up in the smoke crack spot
I be in every hood  see I knows the block
From Watts to one-fo'-fifth by the clothing shops

Nope  I ain't rockin' with them boys I was with
But I'm still blingin' and showin' off my toys in this bitch
When a real nigga show up hoes switch up they games
Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names

Claimin'  she ain't nuttin' like them boys be sayin'
Shit I'm only tryin' to knock the pussy outta the frame
Look here  I tried to chill but they gave me some mills
Me and Mannie back at it  'bout to get another deal

I got my hand wrapped around the steerin' wheel
Hoes like eww  they can't understand the grill
Skip called me up he got them all on chill
Well  let's go and get us some hoes so we can do this heah  why'know

See it was seven o'clock
and the sun had just set
the crew rolled up and said it time to jet
I was kinda hesitatin' cause it was nothing to do
but we always find something to get into
Total-Kaos broke out he said lets go to the movies
he was paying so I wasn't being choosy
jumped in the ride and proceeded to go
""yo what are we goin' to see?""
""yo man I don't know""
but when we got there it was a quarter to nine
to see the main flick it was a long as line
paid to get in and not a second before 
a sucka looked me up and down at the front door 
now I shined on and walked on in 
but he kept on staring again and again
I walked up and said ""what's up""
he said: ""not you""
I turned around and then I looked at my crew
because I know he didn't say what I thought he said
and if he did 
I'm gonna have his head on a platter
the sucka scared out
when we got ill
the brother who tried to front he got his caps pilled
and his homies they got mad 
but they soon broke out
because of what we had

chorus:
because I take out my weapon 
and I quickly start blastin'
I go total loco like a crazy assassin
I look at my posse they say nothings confusin'
why? why? why?
it's just another execution




See it was early 
we was bored uptight
so we rushed up to In-and-Out
to get a bite to eat
I saw a freak I hadn't seen in a while
the one with the crazy eyes and the pretty smile
she was def you know what I mean
the hoe was stacked to the max 
in a skin-tight jean
she sat across the room 
and try to stare at me
then send a note about how she wants to get with me
now I'm wonderin' what has changed
is it that I'm rockin' the house
and that I'm makin' a name for myself
cause when I first met her
all she said I did with her was upset her
I think that sneak she's tryin' to play me down
cause I ain't the one that likes to be clowned
so I told the hoe to leave me alone
I said girl you need to take your stuck up ass home
at this second her boy walked in
I said man do I have to act crazy again
then I grabbed my weapon it's time to get ill
you can say it is cool or you can straight get pilled
with buck shots I mean all over the place
in your back  your side
in your stomach  in your face
cause I don't really care what your girlfriend says
if you keep talkin' shit you get a bullet in your head
so anyway what your beefin' about
if I wanted your hoe she'd  be already turned out
she's jockin me 
she might go with you
now checkin' your girl is what you need to do

I mean I hear what you're saying  I mean
You got carried away in the moment
And I could forgive you
I could do that
I could do anything  if I want to

(1st Verse- Violent J)
I could buy you a Lexus truck with a white leather interior
I could kill off some bears and dogs and shit just to make you a fur coat
I could love you and treat you with class
And have babies falling all out your ass
But thinking about that...
I feel I'd rather kill you
['cause I got you in my car  and you ain't going nowhere bitch  you're dead]

(Chorus x2- Violent J)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch-ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you f*cked my homies

(2nd Verse- Violent J)
I could take all the face paint off and get a real job working for Dad
I would rather take a ten-pound axe and stick it in your daddy's forehead
I could let you move into my house
You'd f*ck the neighbors every time I'd go out
And wipe his nut on my pillow [oh]
But I think I'd rather kill you
['cause we parked all alone and it's real dark anyway  hey]

(Chorus)

(3rd Verse)
I'm the one that killed your precious cat  and stuffed him in your f*cking 
mailbox
If I only hadn't cut off my hair  I'd choke you with all my dreadlocks
When I strain at the moon every night [Heh heh!]
You shouldv'e known something just ain't right
'cause I'm gonna slap you
And the I'm going to kill you
['cause the moon told me to  and it's watching us right now]

(Chorus)

(4th Verse)
I could go back to school instead and try to get my diploma
I'd much rather bang your head on the wall  until you fall into a coma
'cause I can't get you out of my head
I'd cut my head off but the I would be dead
And I ain't the only motherf*cker that's dying!
So let's just die togetherrrrrraaaaaagghhh!!!

(Chorus x4)
Ahhh!! Let's just die together
Ahhh  yeah!! Let's just die together
Me and you  I'll kill you but  can you explain?
Let's just die together

And tonight we'll die together",Another Love Song,1999,Hip Hop

Sittin at the breakfast table  smokin me a spliff
Say wassup to my lil' sis

Her mama mad cause she gave up
Took her to church every week  it couldn't save her
I got a daughter and a son
Before he say 'daddy'  little nigga might say 'gun'
I sit back  I blow a kiss to my mother
Even though she old  the nigga still love her
But I never knew my daddy
Nah  all I knew was some nigga in a Caddy
Stopped by every year by Christmas
Talkin that bullshit he missed us
I don't look like my granny or my mammy
I look like a muthaf*cka named Sammy
My mother musta been a young slut
Always talkin about the days when she had a big fat butt
You gotta do what you gotta do what you gotta do

Well then you're not representing with the LP
If you're not dropping tracks like Madlib
Well then you're not representing with the LP
Well if you're not kicking styles like Wild Child
When then you're not representing with the LP
But if you're not supporting hardcore hip hop
Well then you're not a real hip hop MC

If you're not in tune to this total bliss
Now a days a lot of rappers I like to diss
'cause yo  all up in your songs you be talkin' bout your glocks (what?)
But then you change 'cause you can't be the same around the clock
You be actin' like a Amazon when the camera's on
But when the camera's off  you be actin' soft
'cause you be in that mental state  thinking that ya great
But everywhere around the gates people saying that ya fake
Like dropping out of weight while you're trying to have your cake
But ya jams ain't got no weight and many niggas won't debate

scratch as I rock a show with simultaneous functions we create

Can't understand wack MC's out there  they try and kill it
I'll steal it  take it home  package it and seal it
Bring it out on a daily basis and fry it on a skillet
Question: Will it  will it last forever?
Can't compare it to the past...never!
We're used to touch the mics  uplifting MC's on the rise
Come with the abstract and then straight up vocalize

Most people now a days talk about representing
They strictly smoking Philly's  acting ill  getting bent and
The ways of the industry's mad shady tinted (yeah)

And a nigga be 70 Deep
But if a nigga let his motherf*ckin' scrotum hang over his shoulder
And come up and do a walk by on your bitch-ass
It's nay thun  don't give a f*ck about how much money you got nigga
It's about how you outsmart the next nigga

Bitch  nigga  what the f*ck's up
(Anybody can get it)
Hoe  niggaz  go pull your skirts up
Don't think that you won't get touched  bitch

I'm in your grill now  nigga what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now  bitch what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now  nigga what you gon' do?
Don't think that you won't get touched  bitch

Hoes  hoes  money  roll
Mr. Whup-Ass done stepped in the do'
(Bone crusher)
Bring the pain  to your skull
Y'all niggaz don't want a fight  all y'all want is a hug

Your bark is worse than your bite  with your mean mug
Let's take it to the grass and we'll see what's up
Y'all knows about me  Mr. Streetsweep
Twinkie soft niggaz get dealt with swift-ily

I'm amazin'  I always bring the heat
Pull the cake up through the ground if he f*ckin' with me
Me and E-Fonzarelli  new Starsky & Hutch
Motherf*cker don't act like you can't get touched

Grindin' niggaz bows up and we turn 'em to dust
As the crowd go ah-ooh aah 'cause you know you f*cked up
They don't wanna see me  nicknamed the realest
Don't believe me  ask them Adamsvillers  this A-T-L nigga

I sit at the bar and tear up hundred dollar bills
My car  my Hummer got 26 inch rims
I'm a star on my side of the earth  I bleed the block
Promethazine  codeine  water and hubba rock

Million dollar dreams and fiends and things of that nature
Triple beams and things and T-Mobile paint ya
Told myself  I need to stop pushin' hop
I need to stop pushin' hop so I can buy a WingStop

My young hyenas be bustin' guns  mashin' and pistol packin'
Smokin' so much 'dro that our lungs feel like they collapsin'
Trick I see you and yo' partners laughin'
Jaw-jackin' and scammin' and plottin'

Old soft-ass  medicated  cotton-ass nigga
You're out of line I told you once befo' it's dubya dot
Bust a head dot com  on mine  hit the flo'
And don't come back no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Motherf*cker it's E-4-oh from the Valle-Jo
Still rappin' like I'm po'  beotch

I'm in your grill now  nigga what you gon' do?
Don't think that you won't get touched  bitch

I'ma kill a motherf*cker's ass if I have to
But is it worth it is the question that I ask you
To blast your punk-ass
And is you bleedin'  only to give Satan a damn good

Reason to play with me  look bitch I'm sayin'
You don't listen 'less that tec-9 sprayin' yo' ass
Glass breakin' in your home boy  thinkin' you fast
I never mash out  'til the iron smack up yo' body
Then you pass out  I pray to God for peace

I done best to get my black ass out of these streets
But y'all don't listen 'less I'm cussin' and bustin' the shit
You keep beggin' and I'ma give it to ya you bitch
In your face  your back  your chest  neck and lungs

You want war  you will get it for Mr. Crawfordson
They call me really really doe  ain't no hoe in my blood
A couple slugs bitch you thugs'll give me a hug
Real gangster niggaz raise up  y'all sticky ooh-wee niggaz blaze up
Or get yo' ass sprayed up  bitch nigga

And there you have it

From something that was so meant to be
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now  more and more  I wonder where you are

Do I ever cross your mind  any time?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind  any time?
I miss you

Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear  I hear your voice  driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say

Do I ever cross your mind  any time?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind  any time?
I miss you  I miss you

No more  loneliness and heartache
No more  crying myself to sleep
No more  wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me? Come back to me

Do I ever cross your mind  any time?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind  any time?

New principles  new sounds New rhythms and harmonies have been advanced with unusual frequency Not surprisingly  many of the younger musicians have been quietly digesting This information almost as quiuckly as it has appeared As a result  they've acquired a degree of Musical sophistication which supersedes many of the previous standards of excellence So it's no longer especially relevant to ask the young saxophone player For example  to demonstrate his ability by running through all the Charlie Parker licks  Come little hoods peep out the eyelids Stash a fat gat cause the loops let you dig With a Bloom Swoon and a Full Moon Mecca Bug no fake takes we let alone baits Pitchin' up your cakes might cause a horn rush but then a bass flush Meta more emphasis as I trip this Butter bug pour it out the mouth  O.K. floater to the order don't we wreck before we split From the chaos came the fattest little shit By the soak of it at the point of hammer click You could either read a little Marx or hang with Spiddyocks When the bass faces fix the deepest cuts they're the sickest Then we just make you think you boomed with a quickness This is what's the haps when I go to do my smack Cause the word got around about three cool cats,Appointment at the Fat Clinic,1993,Hip Hop
3454,"Yeah!

Yeah!

Nigga deep in the rhythm  experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom  the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em  i'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits  I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon  I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June  on my feet
I'm getting married soon  walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats  they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build  as far as building I'm the doorman  opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors  tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme  better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps  many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine  holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!

Between churches and liquor stores  my mic leaks
With raps  all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself  thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute  watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous  where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on  now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends  I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team  trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out  where you never been before
Been it since birth  sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back  but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)

A pasado el tiempo why an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes why nuevas modas
Pero el mundo sigue teniendo la misma escena
Alegrias pero tambien tristezas
Amor pero tambien odio why este que te habla ha caminado por sombras
De valle de muerte conociendo las dos caras de la vida
why recopelando episodios por episodio para traernos este dia
why sembrarlos en tu consiencia
A pasado el tiempo why an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes why nuevas modas
Ayer estuve muerto why hoy vivo

[Chorus 2x]
Miden mi lenguayo aquel que habia muerto  de la tumba salio
why ahora contra ataca con lo que aprendio
La voz de la experiencia con potencia regreso (LISTEN)

Dia a dia canto mi presar why represento
Dia a dia tengo a todo el mundo mas adentro
Dia a dia tratan de quedarse con mi asiento
Pero dia a dia se que sigo siendo el mas violento
Porque los violentos somos los que arrebatamos
El reino de los cielos donde nunca nos tiramos
Los que creamos musica madura why expresamos
No es necesario pare que aprendamos why asi que estamos(LISTEN UP KID!)
Sabes que le que traigo en accion mirando bien atento cual es tu reaccion COMO SUENA!
No es solo por la satisfaccion si no por la batalla contra la distraccion
Ra -pap-pap-pa  quita quita la risita -sita que segun la mensaje que te ajita-jita
Asi ke dime dime antes que opines-pines canta algo que no solamente rime-rime AH!
Raperito que ya acabas de nacer AH!
Que es lo que pasa que no te puedo entender AH!
Que por el lado a quien queres aconsejar AH!
why por el lado me queres asesinar
Niño funny canta solamente por la fama why por el money
Aprendete mi lirica mas tirable como el Broni
Alimenticio como el cereal del tigre Tony
why agradable como el honey
Abre los ojos why averigua por ti mismo que al que daran por muerto ha subido del avismo
Todo sucede siempre aunque muchos no quieran
Regreso como el zorro cuando menos se lo esperan  OK!!

[Chorus 2x]

Yo lyrical traqui trac  no traten de engañar al mundo
why diciendo mil palabras por segundo
Porque no tiene sentido porque su contenido no es veral tratan de hacer
Algo especial pero terminan igual
Repeticiones muchos dan consejos pero no dan soluciones
Se obuscan de la fama para obtener posiciones
Buscando reacciones personatico pero con ese estilo
El fracaso esta automatico  maniatico rebelde why mas clemente de inocentes
Si quieres ser diferente no te quites mas lo delincuente
Porque ya es hora de que busques otra tactica
Pues tienes el talento pero te falta mucha practica
Ay va el regreso con el verdadero flow pues aquel que habbia muerto
Pues regresa con el muy largo YO!
why uno arrancando la semilla que no crese
why poniendo en su lugar la que no carece

Frittirta el rapero llego el trero te di un HIP-HOP PAPA EL ESH SHU PAPA
El que returtalo junto furtalo demonstrandome como el aguila que yo vuelo
Contaminando con el virus de mi bula muchas filosofias pero si con la palabra
Creando como trueno que extremese
Graduados de la academia de propisio 3-13
Solo dice ser poem maestro de ceremonia why todos siendo
El nuevo de PC check the flei VA! SHO!
La de Merci si le pone action  dale paso al rey de reyes
Cuando llega tu section!
Repartiendo las buenas nuevas de Salvation
A lo unico que le queda de la generation!

Yo tengo un enemigo que me quiere aplastar CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA CUCHA
Pero cada vez que puedo voy a intentar CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA CUCHA
Agresivo vengo yo con el sonido destal CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA CUCHA
Con el permiso del papa ya no me puede imparar CHACUCHA CUCHU CUCHA JEE!!!
Tengo para la presion  brega con la situacion habla con el corazon
Lucha por la bendicion vela por mi condicion porque la drogadiccion
No respeta posicion tanto como tu educacion
Habran paso al novato asme caso tu forma de expresarte para el mundo es un atraso
Tu musica nos habla de aprender a dar plomasos
Mi musica te enseña a madurar why a dar pasos

3458,"Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said
Get on the bus go get your work
And keep your beeper chirpin' is a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch
Familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff
Provided to you by sack man
Pac man how in the f*ck do you think we gon' do that man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man & ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times
And swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners
That we be bending in Volkswagens and Bonnevilles
Chevrolets and Coupe De Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain
Steering wheel for real you can go on chill out & still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya f*cking beeper bill bitch

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Twice upon a time there was a boy who died twice
And lived happily ever after but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors & baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad need some hope
Like the words maybe  if  or probably more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin' gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught in appearance
It's Outkast Aquemini another Black experience Okay

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear that can't come near that maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben. welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happenin' again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre y'all just gon' have to make amends

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die

Now there ain't no way that you can kill a beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money  in the desert playing golf
Go chase short stack sheiki with a Louis scarf

Chest cold diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai 20 million on a villa loft
And then I step up in the club then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic

La ilaha illa Allah  ha la ili  hay yo

Seven star hotels  Maybach  movies
Sick  big ass  knock-kneed  camel toe  Gucci
Pretty women walk around while security on camel-back
Club on fire now  niggas don't know how to act

Sitting in casinos while I'm gambling with Arafat
Money long  watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know I got the streets bust
While I make ya bow down and make salaat like a Muslim

Use a stack of chips to count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh  about to grow a beard dude
So much cake even the money look weird too

Domestic bread and a broad
I'm tryna eat like Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al-Saud

Dans ma poche  je nai que des punaises de monnaie
Qui contrastent avec larrogance de mes lunettes de soleil !
Jsuis pas loin du vice mais jsuis plus près de lhonnête.
Jfais partie dces mecs bien pubères et corrects.
Je nchangerais pas mon mic pour la plus belle des Rollex 
Je nrangerais pas mon arme pour la prunelle dtes yeux verts !
Nikkfurie ! Mon rap humecte les commères 
220 cordes à mon arc pour le succès dune comète !

Cest un arc-en-ciel pour daltoniens

Tu sais le temps  paraît-il que cest dlargent.
Je sais le prendre  appétissant quand tu lperds.

La coke  lhéro et le crack sont dans vos rues.
A cause des autres et le cash  on en veut plus.
La mort décolle et te claque  quand tentends plus.
Lapothéose et le calme  bien entendu !
Je reste en éveil quand je rêve  correct et concret  comate 
Collectant les sparadraps  connectant lconcept au bar
Connaissant les conséquences de mes erreurs  je compense
Par des compresses dans le cur. Vantez la peur : je la vends !
Vampire tu meurs par le manque  braqueur de banques de sang.
Anti-cutter bureaucrate avec un gang de cancres
En pull-over plutôt crade  jopère et termine le taf.

Cest mon truc  le cas échéant  jsuis un excellent paria !
Ton rap frôle la ménopause dans des proportions précaires 
À ce propos  je nmoppose pas une seconde mais cest très clair :
Ton son veut du repos  un peu dpopo et il décède !
Mon polo a un croco  col repassé presque à léquerre

(ENGLISH VERSION)

Nikkfurie:
In my pocket  I'm only tacks money
Which contrasts with the arrogance of my sunglasses!
I'm not far from the vice but I'm closer to the honest.
J'fais part of puberty these guys well and correct.
I n'changerais not my mic 'for the most beautiful Rollex 
I n'rangerais not my weapon to the pupil of your eyes green!
Nikkfurie! My rap dampen the gossip 
220 string to my bow for the success of a comet!

CHORUS (x2):

It is a rainbow for color blindness 
s'remarque that in fact when Cartesian.
J'lève my bow in the air  I m'sens not very good 
the gaps created when prison.

hitekk:
You know the time  it seems that is l'argent.
I take it  the appetizing when you lose.
My perception of this world is screwed  no worldliness 
that fighting ideas that sell.
The coke  the heroin and crack are in your streets.
Because of the cash and other  it wants more.
The death takes off and smack you when thee more.
The Apotheosis and calmness  of course!
I stay awake when I dream  correct and concrete comata 
Collecting plasters  connecting the concept in the bar
Knowing the consequences of my mistakes  I compensates
By compresses in the heart. Selling fear: I sell!
Vampire you die by the missing robber blood banks.

Merovingian buttock that in a short refrain elk.

This is my trick  if any  I'm an excellent pariah!
Your rap menopause close to a precarious
In this regard  I n'm'oppose not a second but it is very clear:
Your son wants to rest a little and it dies popo!
My shirt has a crocodile  col back almost at right angles ...
If t'pose a jacket? Regardless  I am a cloakroom unreliable 
A man and proud bestial esthete but a few viable ... What the hell?

And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone  alone  alone  alone  alone?

So how you doin'  how you been and how you livin'?
You know baby girl  your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man wit a game plan
Wit a wedding plan

But you know I'm not the man  I had a different plan
For me and you to follow  a runway model
With a self made balla
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life

You did'nt want no fast life  poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a G should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I can't f*ck baby girl  yea  I'm missing times

Creepin' on the low  you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good  we use to freak
And f*ck late night in the bak seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars  money to splurge

Are you still alone  alone  alone  alone  alone?

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin' to figure out who you with  hopefully alone
If that's the case you still got the number to my phone

It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got  I can get that fast
It was something that we had  and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me  let me know I'm on it

I'm still after ya  I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man  understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track  but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was and if your feeling love

Girl you know what's up
'cause I'm still after ya
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone  alone  alone  alone  alone?

I'm still here  right here  if you wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95
With no strings attached
I'll put you on your back

Do those freaky things  make you always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man  you can't say that your mine
'cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign

I'm not a ball player
But I'm a balla  playa
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' lata

Call me a playa 'cause I crush a lot
And I make that money 'cause I make it hot

Ok  ora metti che ha queste frecce veramente questo Cupido che le tira  ecco ha sbagliato mira  ha colpito me e lei no  lei questa notte dorme con qualcuno che non so e io non dormirò  succede o almeno dicono  in un film lo troverebbero poetico romantico una cotta a senso unico  io mi vedo comico e rido di emozioni senza traettoria guardando lei dispedersi nell'aria.  Ora veniamo a noi signora che mi giri in testa  che ieri sera sei uscita col mio cuore in tasca labbra rosse di rubino il mio ricordo mentre bevo vino il mio compagno di San Valentino. Sei la regina di un ignaro re fra gli uomini  mia privata fantasia lascia che ti esamini  occuperei la lingua mia in approfondite indagini  impartirei il tuo corpo che nemmeno immagini  ma l'aria è di tutti e di nessuno  possa respirarla e sporcarla con del fumo e ti respiro anche quando tiro dalla mia Marlboro soffiando gioco a fare anelli con i tuoi capelli d'oro  dura messo male da paura barman dammi tu la cura stasera sono fuori gara  brindiamo alla memoria di una storia senza gloria una febbre d'amore necessaria come aria,Aria,1998,Hip Hop
3479,"Here's a vision Imagine a whole globe made with precision Continents of brown soil with green grass That compliments deep seas and trees with multi-colored leaves Mountain ranges that survive through the ages Plus show expressions of time on rock faces Now gaze up towards the glorious sky Only appreciated by a powerful eye As I understand  man is to cherish the land As we coexist hand in hand But as time has past Man has created a vast  Mass of trash that has the capability to smash Your natural desire to explore your state of being and Discover you fire For instance when a child is born It possesses no intelligence of hate or scorn But as it learns of hard ways It becomes tuned from its original nature As we destroy nature in the name of cash All justified by laws made by the legislature You never say 'cause that claim they aims to Seek justice but ain't it a shame That that isn't the case yo we all are so tame That we're all fair game That's why they got our name Address social security number Even though where you bought your last rest Or mattress have you saying ""Oh that's just the way things are""  Then I explain that you're so far from your core You need to explore I wake up in the morning in war and saw And go look for more Weapons being prepared for nuclear war And then when I found some no this is to god  hit The ground son With strong winds to make the clouds run Step up in the laboratory Keep it mandatory Their response: Inflammatory Now their dome's all puffed up 'Cause they f*cked up Give me the data chips I'll reverse gravity So mad they'll flip  Show these f*ckers the light The adequate side of the scene  natty dips Mankind should feel the effects As he rips through the environment Mash up the Earth's power as if It were required The whole things blowin' a cold heart Stand as he asks where the fire went Trapped in an Ice age and while you're defrostin' I kick open the door and let some Holocaust in Then I remain sober in the galaxy Take the form of the sun So I can shine emphatically Then I shed light on the tragedy  Step aside just to make way for remorse and apathy Then I perform something you can all see As I change the climate from cold to balmy As temperatures rise I squeeze acid water out of the skies To burn out your eyes Cause you could never see what I devise And get your five lives and nine tries But usually nobody survives cause I Elevated far above and beyond So you could be bombed  crushed to dust You can be harmed You can be armed with shanks and tanks Bayonets  missile threats Yet I still launch lyrical text  That gets so intense It could disassemble all of those other meds So you should fear what the god invents Since I was sent under the name of Lif Which means to uplift It's my never ending duty to attempt to shift your mind From one train of thought to a more positive state So then in turn you can create Control your own fate Rather than having those with wealth dominate and complicate Living to the point where we're all imprisoned People we should all pick our minds it's time!  Look at how the world is designed It's major We should all walk out of our manger And start to educate the nearest stranger Ignorance has no remainder I manifest  prophesier visions of danger With seven lines I show you seven signs Time's of the essence Choose before you lose your physical presence Perpetuate wickedness or walk along the path of god The force from which we were all created Stand amongst prosperity Or fall devastated  Another victim of hatred In a land where nothing is sacred Except for these thoughts that I share With no fear to make you all aware of the nightmare I see you puttin' in a little work but we're not quite there Climb out of your darkness  the light is quite clear We're still to concerned with jewels and hype gear But I'ma drop my thoughts until you open your eyes  arise It doesn't matter what your color creed race or size  arise",Arise,NONE,Hip Hop

People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim  ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you  but I don't f*ck with hospitals
Spit the gospel  truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham  Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block  I'm tracing your footsteps  I keep the faith in you
Your love  plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through  my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive  shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters  rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad

And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own

No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you  threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four  cock it back
Drop the flow  rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school  but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood  you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that  this is a legacy and we a part of that

Just do that thing that you do

Lover's kites  are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose  can profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why

Blow it high for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we putting one six feet underground
So bless
What goes up must come down

Now my buzz is gone  and I need to re-up on reality
Can't let me see them weak I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some  and since when
So put 'em high  and tell 'em this
You can't aim  but you never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some  and since when
So raise a glass to the memories and set em' free
And fill up all the ashtrays
Fill up all the ashtrays

Tomorrow when you wake up and realise life ain't fair
Throw it back and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had  then it's gone
That is why  something will always go wrong

Komm' ich mit Pitbull  mein ich nicht den Latinorapper
Und dieser G-Hot sieht aus  als wär' er minderjährig
Wieso machst du auf Mann mit deinem Kinderpenis?
Viele der Rapper essen kein Schweinefleisch
Aber schlucken kräftig den Scheidenschleim
„Von Salat schrumpft der Bizeps“ sagen Kolle und Majoe
Ich füg' noch hinzu  von Möhren weitet sich der Anus
Bekämpfe den Feind  mein Bandana weiß
Ich komme rein und kille deinen Blenderverein

Ficke deine Mutter  wer ist fresher am Mic?
Banger for life  ich bin der Boss
Komm' in deine Hood rein mit einer Glock
Farid zum Bang  ich parke den Benz
Und gebe danach deinem Bodyguard Schellen  Bitch
Deutsche Rapper  bald schlafen sie auf Holzbänken
Farid Bang  Armumfang  22 Zollfelgen
Fick deine Karriere  dein Mädel wird gekidnappt

Weil 'ne Zeitung sagt  dass Farid Bang ein Taliban sei
Ey  jeden Tag nur Bizeps und Brust
Wer behauptet  dass von Anabol die Gliedlänge schrumpft?
Ey  ich komm nie wieder in Amiland rein
Weil 'ne Zeitung sagt  dass Farid Bang ein Taliban sei
Ey  Motherf*cker  es ist Asphalt Massaka

Da ist sogar ein Strohhalm breiter""
Deutsche Rapper kriegen Tritt in die Visage
Bin kein T-Rex  doch mein Schwanz  er ist dicker als meine Arme
Werde ich verhaftet  nachdem ich den Paul klatsche
Macht es vielleicht klick wie Maustasten
Und ich fick die Zuhälter der Feinde
Denn mein Arm hat kaum Spielraum in 'nem LKW-Reifen
Ey  willkommen im Krieg  ihr Wannabe Gs
Alle machen Welle  doch wollen kein Beef
Ich komm in 'nem Lambo zerficke die Mama von diesem elenden Ferris MC
Ich nehm' Anabol  denn ich bleibe der Lover
Der Mütter der Rapper  der Banger ist back
Der kriminelle  illegale  rappende Mack
Ich komm' mit einer Gun und alle Rapper sind weg
Rap ist Cybersex  glaub mir  nix mit Straße
Denn ich seh' Trailerpark und Jaysus über Twitter blasen
Ey und ich schieß' aus dem Benz mit Walther
Auf MOK  doch ich treff' seinen Insolvenzverwalter

Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold

I went to the party
Ya know what I mean?
I want to the party
Just me  a lonely MC
You can pop the cork 
Said you can twist the cap
I'm at this party
And I'm here to rap!

I went to the party  but I couldn't get in
I asked the bouncer if he knew my girl Hesta Prynn
He said  ""I know that girl  are you in that band?""
I said  ""I think I'm on the list  could you stamp my hand?""

He said  ""Step inside girl  you look alright
Hold up - do you satisfy the minimum height?
You gotta be this tall to ride tonight""
I said  ""I might be short  but I can still party
I can shake it on the floor like Melissa Alardi!""

I went to the party  but I'll never go back  yo
The speakers were shitty and the jams were whack
This girl at the bar said  ""Northern who?""
I said  ""It's Northern State  haven't you heard of my crew?

Yo we rock the stage anyway we want 
Hell I'll rock this party like a debutante
Riverdale's too Kiwanis
True party people want us  yo
Keep it real  I gotta break the seal

Close my eyes as I leave the house (close my eyes and i)
And then I'm at the party and I'm fillin out (im at the party and i)
And then I'm watchin my worries as they floatin by (watch all my worries just)
It's just  there they go  slippin away now (slip away)

All the way from Avenue D
Lookin for Katie Cassidy
I noticed this guy was starin at me

He said  ""Hi "" I said  ""Hi  do I know you?""
He said  ""Yeah  don't you run in that girl rap group?""
Uh huh ho  you're the one with that liberal arts
Academic  literary kinda name  right?

I said  ""Like Gorgeous George  my name is Hideous Hesta
Rhyme with pizazz  and I am the masta
Shout out to Cynthia plasta casta
Speed up the tempo and I'll go faster!""

Uhn! You wanna know what it's about?
I like to party but I never go out
Mailin' and I'm maxin'  callin' and I'm faxin'
I need some more relaxin'  'cause my job is real taxin'!

I got the perfect party in my mind

We know you be hustlin' backwards  Electric Slide on rewind
My pockets is looking like rerun
I've begun to dethrone  you sippin' on that Seagram's
Talkin' bout you gone kill somethin'
Niggas must think they real or somethin'
Go on ahead and pop a pill or somethin'
You ain't f*ckn' with me  might as well OD
So after that one  take ten times three
Danny Brown and that boy Rustie
Got the game on lock like we changed the keys
No you can't get in  but your whore out  treat that mouth like police raid a house
Bust all up in it  nuts up in it
Brand new tenant  moved all up in it
That's no lease  this ain't rented
Came back now  it's OG-scented
Who the f*ck you think ya'll is
I'm a grown ass man  I don't play with no kids
Back in 2003 used to post up and roll up bag of pounds of the meat
Used to trap OG with the E  on the Greyhound bus one pair of jeans
Touchdown in the city
Like ""Nigga where the fiends?""
Now I do the same thing
But it's with 16s
Get money my nigga like a poster  If I don't then I might go postal
Back a nigga down like Howard tryna post you
If you play around with a nigga  might smoke you
Beware what you say in the vocals
Hood story  everybody going loco
Gotta put a pussy nigga in a chokehold
No joke that's the code of survival
Battle royal - everybody your rival
In the ghetto everybody going psycho

I'm a maniac  Brainiac when I'm aiming at
Knock your brain out the hat while I cop that
You can't block that and just (?)
Stop that  you ain't 'bout that
Said my loud niggas where ya hoes at
Double sacks and a couple packs put ya daughter's fingers in a mouse trap
Off that cause we on what
Can't come back like you stole somethin'
Nigga might as well  let me hold somethin'
Before I take that and your ho for frontin'
Blew a (?) like smoke somethin'
Sippin' OG  might roll somethin'
Pop a bottle  might toast somethin'
Nigga keep hatin'  I'mma toast somethin'
Weapon off that black and decker
Putting lean in my Dr Pepper
Chess shit and you playing checkers
Hit the chest (?)
Mac attack on that ho shit  might walk around  get your throat split
If you don't know shit  better know this
F*ck around  hocas-pocus
You in focus  I'm a locust  see them big pictures and stay focused
Your ho luck atrocious  my bitches look ferocious
Breakin' shit psychosis  you niggas talkin' about practice
Roll around with that acid  if you don't know start askin'
Middle man be taxin'  made a couple hundred  kept stackin'
Know it sound like I'm braggin' but know you do got (?)

I don't gotta say shit  tell your bitch suck my dick",Attak,2014,Hip Hop

Hey  yo je débarque dans la place Air Force neuve pas d'Adidas Alerte au bling-bling  bi-bi-bi-bi-biatch B2O chef de gang sur bateau d'esclaves Laquelle de ces rappeurs veux test un MC de Bakel? Ici je suis en visite  le roi en visu J'arrive en ville-zi  brille-zi repart en vie-zi Ca capitule dans l'industrie c'est la crise J'm'arrête au feu les MC lavent mon parebrise Ni deux ni une  aucune apparition sans hémoglobine T'es à la fin de ton film remballe et rembobine Je défraie pas la chronique  je la fume Si j'avais la maille à Bekham sa femme serait ma bonniche Mon fils à l'école tu seras imbattable Si tu échoues et que je pars avant toi Prends mes sous  jette ton cartable Et je m'imagine entrain de ffer-ta A 2.50 sur le droit chemin voiture pée-ta  À quoi ça sert d'être célèbre  sans le mériter J'ai toujours la vérité au bout des lèvres Et le passé me suit de jour comme de nuit Pourrais-je y arriver au bout de mes rêves?  À quoi ça sert d'être célèbre  sans le mériter? J'ai toujours la vérité pendue aux bouts des lèvres Et le passé me suit  de jour comme de nuit J'sais pas dans quel état j'vais arriver au bout de mes rêves J'ai le coeur solide  j'ai les mains pleines Quand elles seront vides me diras-tu que tu m'aimes? Votre système je n'y crois pas Non  sans phares à xénon  moi  je m'y vois pas  À quoi ça sert d'être célèbre  sans le mériter J'ai toujours la vérité au bout des lèvres Et le passé me suit de jour comme de nuit Pourrais-je y arriver au bout de mes rêves?

3551,"Je m'épanouis à travers ce que je vis  hamdoullah
Mais au fond de mon âme je ressens toujours cette même douleur
Je tiens l'équilibre entre bonnes nouvelles et drames
Dehors y'a que du haram  ça sort les armes pour quelques grammes
J'pense à mes proches qui se préoccupent de mon sort
Si j'allais voir un psy  il comprendrait la complexité de son job
J'pense à mes potes qui sont en taule  d'autres qui sont morts
J'pense aux rappeurs qui glorifient le crime et je me dis qu'il ont tort
N'oubliez pas que les petits frères sont à l'écoute
N'oubliez pas qu'Iblis et Lucifer sont parmi nous
Casser les clichés est un problème trop difficile à résoudre
J'vais pas trancher les cous de ceux qui ne répondent pas au Salam Aleïkoum 
Un grand respect à ceux qui me soutiennent depuis le début
Avant j'étais sur le banc  grâce à vous je peux marquer des buts
J'ai de l'espoir mais bon c'est rude
Je n'ai pas fait de grosses études
Grâce à vous parfois le soleil éclaire ma vie sous le déluge
Parce que ma bulle est une cellule
Mon vote fait pas le poids dans leurs urnes
Heureusement que ma daronne n'a pas accouché un soir de pleine lune
Qu'est-ce que je pourrais faire de ma vie à part rapper ?
J'ai posé des CV y'a un peu plus de deux piges  personne ne m'a rappelé
J'ai l'air embarrassé  je me suis juré de ne pas lâcher
C'est ça retourner dans la rue  dealer ou taffer à la chaîne
C'est ça faire du blé  esquiver ou manger la gamelle
Un choix entre compter des palettes ou bicrav des lamelles
Pas à l'abri d'un accident ou d'une maladie grave
J'te souhaite la paix que tu sois barbu ou que tu aies la kippa
Le monde part en couilles  c'est écrit et c'est ainsi
Le générique de fin est triste et beaucoup plus long que celui d'un film
Je plaide coupable si la vérité est un crime
Si la liberté a un prix  je ne fais que lire à travers ma rétine
Regarde les tragédies  Israël  Palestine
L'Afrique est amaigrie à l'heure l'Amérique nous souhaite bon appétit
On vit dans le gouffre  les autorités s'en foutent
C'est la jungle et ils nous laissent crever comme Ingrid Bétancourt 
La joie et la tristesse demeurent indélébiles

and in the middle in the front yo
repeat 3x 

Attention all audible angels
Before billions burn before brains blow
Communication cannot calmly converse
Demographics delegated dissoluted diverse
Evidently eventually everything ends 
First fascinate friends force foes to fend
Gradually the greater good grows and graduates
History has holes however humans hesitate
I invest indigenous interests
Journals journey justify jokers jest
The king of corrupt kings keeps killing kids
Live for life and love levitating lids
Money makes many mens minds miss
Nevermind newness now we need nourish
Oppose only one organization
Pray and protect the peaceful population

Chorus

Quietly question quality
Rhettmatic revolutionizes record reality
(Rhettmatic scratches)
Substitute scratches save the songs symmetry
Twenty six tabs of turntable tapestry
Understand the underground unsung
Vegetate vast victorious visions
Watch the weather wither in the wrong way
Never Xerox a xenophobes X-ray
Yes you're young so yell that's just you
Zoning in the zero of the zyclon zoo

Ah  heute lass' ich den Job (Job)
Gott  ich hasse den Trott (Trott)
Noch so'n paar Tage mehr
Man ich schwör'  dann platzt mir der Kopf
Immer nur funktionier'n nach Regeln und Listen
Will inmitten der Schnappschüsse mal das Leben erwischen
Und bin weg  weit weg  da wo dir Fehler verzeihbar sind
An den Ort  wo wir mit 16 dachten  wo wir mit 30 sind
Kein Ärgern und Mist  denn als merkten wir's nicht
Alltag ist Treibsand  du steigst ab  je stärker du trittst
Immer nur langleben von Mahnung zu Mahnung und Ratenabzahlung
Für ein Mal im Jahr  14 Tage Malle
Ich bin raus  kann schon nach dem Ende 'nen Anfang sehen
Ganz egal  wie lang' der Fall  solange die Landung steht
Vielleicht Saint Tropez  vielleicht weit hinter den Bergen
Vielleicht nur Bielefeld  doch dort  wo noch Grinsen was wert ist
Endlich Laufen lernen
Endlich angefangen  aufzuhör'n (Ah)

Und heute bin ich aufgewacht
Augen aufgemacht
Sonnenstrahlen im Gesicht  halte die Welt an
Und bin auf und davon (Hey)
Auf und davon (Hey)

Bin den Krach so gewohnt  für mich Stille nun Lärm
Kann und will das nich' mehr  in Fabrikhallen eingeschlossen
Als wär' mir das Leben dort am Fließband vorbeigeschossen
Tag ein  Tag aus  da rein  da raus
Unentwegtes Hundeleben  ja  nein  brach aus
Hauptsache Miete passt  Hauptsache Kitaplatz
Stotter' das Leasing ab  jeden Morgen von sieben an
Murmeltiertag leben  zu Jesus beten  treu zur Frau
Fleißig und produktiv  ewig lebt der deutsche Traum
Bin ab heute raus  Zeit  um zu gehen
Soweit es mich trägt  verbrannte Brücken leiten den Weg
Mach' mein eigenes Ding  keine Last mitzutragen
Der Trick is' atmen  die Antwort einfach nich' zu fragen (Ah)

3560,"Ich wollte grade bleiben auf meinem Weg hier raus
Jetzt  wo ich fast am Ziel bin  merk ich  es geht nicht auf
Wenn das 'ne Prüfung ist  ich nehm's in Kauf
Ich seh wie diese Menschen Hass kriegen  nur durch den Mercedes-Sound
Mein Plan war's irgendwann hier raus zu schaffen
Jetzt wollen sie Auge machen
auf dem Weg zu 100.000 Platten
Zehn Millionen Klicks und die Probleme beginnen jetzt
Ignorieren ist der Weg  raus aus diesem Spinnennetz
Es sind die eigenen Komplexe  die sie scharf machen
So  als hätt' ich Mord begang'  Erfolg war meine Tatwaffe
Gnadenlos  allesamt nur schadenfroh
Doch stehen diese Menschen ganz alleine vor mir war das alles gar nicht so
Ich behalte den Fokus und lass mich nicht mehr bremsen
Die Macht in meinen Händen  in der Stadt eine Legende
Rebell solang ich kämpfe
auch wenn sie mich zutiefst hassen
Wollt es nur ans Ziel schaffen und meine Musik machen
Jetzt wollen sie glücklich werden durch meine Vernichtung
Verhasst in jede Richtung  geblendet von der Missgunst
Schreibe mit Feuer und hab deshalb an der Hand Verbrennung'
Redet was ihr wollt  euer Neid ist meine Anerkennung

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht  betet  dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh  betet  dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins  betet  dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht  betet  dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut  die ich wegasche  sind falsche Freunde
Yeah  ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität

Riech den Neid in der Luft  dir bleibt nur noch Frust
Weil sich auf der weiten Welt kein Schwein für dich juckt
Ich bin oben angekommen und das bereit dir Druck
Doch in Wahrheit macht dich dein eigenes Leid nur kaputt  Bruder
Deine Denkweise  guck  sie macht voll keinen Sinn
Du kriegst das Kotzen  wenn du hörst  dass ich erfolgreich bin
Jetzt ist es offiziell  KC ist der Überflieger
Je höher ich komme  fällst du in deiner Psyche tiefer
Seitdem ich auf der Zwei war  seh ich so viel Neid
Ungerechtigkeit macht sich breit auf dem Weg zur Eins
Wenn Blicke töten könnten  würd' ich jetzt im Grab liegen
Sie würden gerne den Plan schmieden und scharf schießen
Sie wollen dich runterreißen  von der Karriereleiter
Wegbegleiter  die sich wünschen  dass du in dei'm Leben scheiterst
Was willst du machen  wenn sich Neid in deiner Gegend breit macht?
Ich bet für alle meine Feinde an jedem Freitag
Du bist besessen  in dein' Träumen siehst du mich verrecken
Doch ich bin Rebell  ich bin hart  ich bin nicht zu brechen
Und wenn es sein muss  schieß' ich mit der Smith & Wesson
Ich fick den Richter  weil nur Gott richtet  und das dürft ihr nicht vergessen

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht  betet  dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh  betet  dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins  betet  dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht  betet  dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut  die ich wegasche  sind falsche Freunde
Yeah  ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität",Auge,2014,Hip Hop

Durchquere die Stratosphäre  die Sterne sind zum Greifen nah
Und sie folgen meiner Stimme wie verzaubert
Ergriffen von dem Licht meiner Aura  ich geb' Power

Mit dem Mic in der Hand und ich
Steh' an vorderster Front und lass nicht zu  dass sie triumphier'n
Glaub mir  ich zieh' in den Kampf für dich
Sie können mir alles nehm'  aber diese Flamme nich' löschen
Es is' die Aura!
Könnt ihr sie spür'n? Meine Aura!
Sie woll'n sie haben  diese Aura!
Der Grund hinter allem
Sie probier'n es doch löschen nie diese Flamme  die in mir brennt

Ich zog die Schuhe an und
Erklomm Berge  durchschwamm Meere
Verlor beinahe meine Fährte doch fand zurück
Ich saß alleine da  den Schädel voll Leere
Scheiß auf meine Lehre  ich kann da leider nichts lern'  das is' verrückt
Ich führte Kriege gegen Brüder und fing mir paar Narben ein
Du siehst sie  trotzdem ging ich als Sieger aus diesen Prüfungen
Der Swoosh für die Nikes  Apfel für den Mac
Sie rufen 'Shit'  als würd' ich pures Abführmittel rappen
Bitte  was für Argumente? Lass sie ihre Blogs schreiben
Beat  Karosse  Motor  Stimme  das hier ist die Hochzeit
Los  pack die Böller wieder ein  es klingt wie Dynamit
Ihr Draufgänger nennt mich Traumfänger  ich bin über ihn'
Der Beste von den Besten  die Taten unvergessen
Zog als Einziger das Schwert aus dem Stein hinaus  König Essah!
Ich füge mich mein Schicksal  folge dem Auftrag
Mit dem Herzen rein wie das Licht meiner Aura  ich geb' Power

Mit dem Mic in der Hand und ich
Steh' an vorderster Front und lass nicht zu  dass sie triumphier'n
Glaub mir  ich zieh' in den Kampf für dich

I had to pump my brakes man she
Looked like no other kind  you can see in your mind
I had to take this one with me
Now  could you imagine like everything you want
Every piece of your fantasy was just like a dream come true
One thing for me to do I had to get this girl

Girl you know I see in your eye
I'm checking you  you're checkin' me
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill with your man AV
Let's spend some time  sip on some wine
Baby relax let's take our time
We both can see it's meant to be
Come chill wit ya man AV

You know there's no limit to things that I wanna do
I'll make your every dream come true
Tickets first class for two  penthouse with ocean views
Now feel me while I set the mood
Dinner by the candle light girl  get cha mind right
And damn you are the sexy type  baby girl I got plans for you
Disregard all the rules tonight I'm getting into you

First I'm gonna work ya body from the top
Get around the middle baby I won't stop

It's an example of makin' good love
And the walls is shakin' and the bed is breakin'
And the lips is movin' and the hips is groovin'  yes
And I got the protection for this type of affection
When you're pitting your best in there ain't no time for restrain

We'll be kings forever  oh oh oh  Holding on together  oh oh oh  Feeling so much better oh oh oh  When everything was wrong and everything was gone We ran to Avalon.  I fought till I had the fight left  Risked my death  Walked with conviction in everyone of my steps  My strengths water enough  To wash away any of the stains on my rep  Yeah  I fought off voulcher's  Went against odds when I was short and soldiers  I asked not for my burden to be lightened But if I may have broader shoulders So as I may carry the weight all the doubt I had in me has been ? So from now til the day I'm carried away I will never walk around what stands in my way F*ck if they ain't letting off cos neither will I When I die from the ashes any ? Long as my ? and my faith keep me alive Fear is something you will see in my eyes.  We'll be kings forever  oh oh oh  Holding on together  oh oh oh  Feeling so much better oh oh oh  When everything was wrong and everything was gone We ran to Avalon.  I left competion out for the count no abacus Fought for the crowd  fought down challengers When my massacre was ordained I remained through pain forged my sword  my Excalibur.

Kesepian bila
Dia tidak di sampingmu
Sesungguhnya arif dan tahu
Cintanya dua
Dan kau bukanlah pertama
Walau dicurah segalanya
Tapi tenteramkah diminda?
Pendapatmu usia tak material
Walaupun dua kali gandamu
Benarah  benarkah kau menyintainya
Ataupun kau berpura  semata hanya kerana harta
*CHORUS:
AWAS
AWAS
AWAS
GERAK LANGKAH MU...
Sememangnya benar
Kau wanita jelita
Zahir dikau sempurna
Jadi idaman jejaka
Dia berkeluarga
Bukan lagi rahsia
Mestikah kau terus bersama?
Mestikah kau terus menggoda?
Pendapatmu usia tak material
Cintamu hanyalah kepadanya
Pernahkah  pernahkah kau tanya terfikir
Kau bukan yang pertama  dan mungkin bukan yang terakhir

Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Ah  y'all done up and done it
Man y'all done up and done it

My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin through my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?)
No headphones  we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water  roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC  Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler  (Heeeyy man!)
All play flirtin all his customers  and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back porch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some  suffered for more  takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin  but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on  but it was hard - stepped up  took charge
Ran through what we scared up  but what was we afraid for?
Look what we made of  heart that what made us
Being here is alright  but must believe we won't fall!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep them vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awww!

Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awww!

My yegga  we hog wild  bet that from that roota to that toota-file
Hell naw  them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud  them kinfolk  twankies with them hundred-spokes
Skullied on that front porch  plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 headin down to Cashville
Glass filled  to the tippy-top  back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent  left with pocket lints
A damn shame  gotta grind anything and everything
Jimmy Crack Corn  cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time  a gravel road  to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back  and back and forth  with same jeans and nappy 'fro

I might  hop off the Harley  spoke mine like Bob Marley
Not parties with charties  wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin  Prophit gotta like them
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life f*ckin with them!

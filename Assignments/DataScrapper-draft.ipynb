Tell me what you done and tell me what you seen\"  Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell It wouldn\\'t be the first time I spent New Years in jail I said \"Sheriff it happened last night about ten I thought that my wife had been drinking again\"  When she walked in from works she was white as a ghost I thought maybe she\\'d seen one of them UFO\\'s But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head And stopped on the roof of our good neighbor Red  Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shutter A freezer full of venison standing right on Red\\'s gutter Well my hands were a shaking as I grabbed my gun When outta Red\\'s chimney this feller did run  And slung on his back was this bag overflowin\\' I thought he\\'d stolen Red\\'s stuff while old Red was out bowlin\\' So I yelled \"Drop it fat boy hands in the air\" But he went about his business like he hadn\\'t a care  So I popped off a warning shot over his head Well he dropped that bag and he jumped in that sled And as he flew off I heard him extort \"that\\'s assault with intent Roy I\\'ll see you in court. \"I\\'ll tell you what sheriff if you put a subnet\" On me I won\\'t show up ill hold up

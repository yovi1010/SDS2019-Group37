4,La combriccola del blasco  Si è fermata dentro a un bosco  Che nessuno aveva voglia di abitare  Fu così che per dispetto  Che qualcuno da su un tetto  Tutto a un tratto da sul tetto si mise a urlare  Guardate l'animale  Guardate l'animale  La combriccola del blasco  Era poco più di un pugno  Ma se si stringeva colpiva molto duro  Fu così che per non fare  Per non fare troppo male  Lasciò il bosco per un posto  più sicuro  Magari un po' più buio  Ma molto più sicuro  Magari un po' più buio  Ma molto più sicuro  La combriccola del blasco  Era tutta gente a posto  Ma qualcuno continuava a dirne male  Si diceva che quel blasco  Fosse stato prima un rospo  Tramutato non so come e anche male  In uno strano animale  Con delle voglie strane  Uno strano animale  Con delle voglie strane  La combriccola del blasco  Arrivati a questo punto  Sparì dentro un buco profondo come il mare  A vedere se quel tale  Arrivava fin là in fondo  Arrischiando  per lui stesso? d'affogare Magari in mezzo al mare  Per prender l'animale  Vieni già in fondo al mare  A prender l'animale  Vieni già in fondo al mare  Che ti do l'animale,"""Blasco"" Rossi",1987,Pop

You're my medicine  It's a sinking feeling  Pulls me through the seat of chairs. When will you come rescue me  Find solace  and then take me there?

That's all you got?

I don't put glue sticks in my nose and um
But my face pasted to linoleum
Kitchen floor shit
Some college dorm shit

Face down in a bloodstained carpet
Get chicks at the farmers' market
White girls buy produce
Take them home  make them drink Grey Goose

I drink a can of Sparks and try to freestyle
Ex-girlfriend's on speed dial
Oh that's a drunk dial  drunk sexting
Drunk stagger  drunk swagger

I don't rap good  it don't matter
Can't sing good  it don't matter
Cause I'm blacked out sleepwalking
On a quest for God at my friend's apartment

One: Sleep is the best way to save money
Two: Money is the best way to have sex
Three: Sex is the best way to feel nothing
Four: Nothing happens if you're asleep

49,"It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot  now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away  dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So  up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot  Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says  I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very  very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

278,I know you have time But believe me it will fly by  And if it don't treat you right I want you to know that you can call me. Into each life  some rain must fall But if the storm becomes too much for you all  Don't be afraid to enter my life I will be there when you call me.  Don't let your pride get in the way of your view Of how we used to be  Oh  to you it's long ago  but to me  yesterday  The passing of time is like the crashing of waves It wears down on your memory and you can forget That if it all gets too much i will always be there For you to call me  if you need to call me.  Into each life  some rain must fall But when the storm becomes too much for you all  Don't be ashamed to enter my life I will be there when you call me.,(When You) Call Me,1998,Pop

Para que se vea desde alta mar
Yo buscaba el rumbo de regreso
Sin quererlo encontrar

Pie detrás de pie
Iba tras el pulso de claridad
La noche cerrada apenas se abría
Se volvía a cerrar

Un faro quieto nada sería
Guía mientras no deje de girar
No es la luz lo que importa en verdad
Son los 12 segundos de oscuridad

Para que se vea desde alta mar
De poco le sirve al navegante
Que no sepa esperar

Pie detrás de pie
No hay otra manera de caminar

Revelada en un inmenso radar

Un faro para sólo de día

Puede ser que tú me eleves

En cada espejo voy viendo el reflejo de mi situación

Pero sé quién eres y sé lo que quieres

Y es que no tengo el valo para decirte adiós

Peligrosamente pierdo la respiración
Se mueve el tiempo en cada momento
Y no hay explicación

Aunque sé muy bien que duele
Yo regreso a verte
No quiero perderte

407,"Lo nuestro duró
Lo que duran dos peces de hielo
En un güisqui on the rocks
En vez de fingir
O  estrellarme una copa de celos
Le dio por reír
De pronto me vi
Como un perro de nadie
Ladrando  a las puertas del cielo
Me dejó un neceser con agravios
La miel en los labios
Y escarcha en el pelo

Tenían razón
Mis amantes
En eso de que  antes
El malo era yo
Con una excepción
Esta vez
Yo quería quererla querer
Y ella no
Así que se fue
Me dejó el corazón
En los huesos
Y yo de rodillas

Desde el taxi
Y  haciendo un exceso
Me tiró dos besos
Uno por mejilla
Y regresé
A la maldición
Del cajón sin su ropa
A la perdición
De los bares de copas
A las cenicientas
De saldo y esquina

Y  por esas ventas
Del fino laina
Pagando las cuentas
De gente sin alma
Que pierde la calma
Con la cocaína
Volviéndome loco
Derrochando
La bolsa y la vida
La fui  poco a poco
Dando por perdida

Y eso que yo
Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías
Para no comprarla
Con bisutería
Ni ser el fantoche
Que va  en romería
Con la cofradía

Del santo reproche
Tanto la quería
Que  tardé  en aprender
A olvidarla  diecinueve días
Y quinientas noches
Dijo hola y adiós
Y  el portazo  sonó
Como un signo de interrogación
Sospecho que  así
Se vengaba  a través del olvido
Cupido de mi
No pido perdón

¿Para qué? Si me va a perdonar
Porque ya no le importa
Siempre tuvo la frente muy alta
La lengua muy larga
Y la falda muy corta
Me abandonó
Como se abandonan
Los zapatos viejos
Destrozó el cristal
De mis gafas de lejos
Sacó del espejo
Su vivo retrato

Y  fui  tan torero
Por los callejones
Del juego y el vino
Que  ayer  el portero
Me echó del casino
De torrelodones
Qué pena tan grande
Negaría el santo sacramento
En el mismo momento
Que ella me lo mande
Y eso que yo

Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías
Para no comprarla
Con bisutería
Ni ser el fantoche
Que va  en romería

414,"How 'bout a tear for the year of 1960 
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall 
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall 

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble 
That was brewing in the Asian way 
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A. 

In the city of the lost and found 
It's hard to get a break 
Hard to stop from getting turned around 
And make the same mistakes 

My reputation's on the line 
The final day of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso 
I practiced 61 minutes a day 
I could never reach the keys 
But it was all OK 

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother 
That could brighten up the darkest nights 
It's just another sign of love 
Whenever we would fight 

It's all the same twenty years ago 
As it is right now 
Like a tour at the closing show 
When I take my bow 

My reputation's on the line 
At the start of '79 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 
I've played this part so many times 
Since the end of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today

442,"You've gone too far
I'm on my way
You can tell the concierge
To bring around my car
You've gone too far

You said too much
Things you shouldn't say
You can keep your violins
Your sins  your care  your touch
You said too much

Get off the ground now baby
Just shut your mouth and maybe
This can all be done
I won't tell anyone

You showed them all
Things they shouldn't see
You lost the sense
The permanence  the flair  the ball
You showed them all

Well now I know
You take everything
Your car  your cash
Your shoes  your flash
You so and so
Well now I know

And I even think it's funny
Don't say you're sorry  bunny
You can keep the wings
Just let me get my things

You go too far

Por fin se hacía realidad 
Tanto oír hablar de tu silencio 
Dicen que te arrastra como el mar
Llené de libros mi maleta 
También de fotos tuyas de antes 
Dibujé tu sonrisa junto a la mía 
Me dormí con tu abrigo en el sofá

Quiero estar a tu lado 
Quiero mirarte y sentir 
Quiero perderme esperando 
Yo quiero quererte o morir

Y en el momento que vi tu mirada buscando mi cara 
La madrugada del 20 de enero saliendo del tren 
Me pregunté que sería sin ti el resto de mi vida 
Y desde entonces te quiero  te adoro y te vuelvo a querer

Cogí un tren que no dormía 
Y vi tu cara en un cristal 
Era un reflejo del sol de mediodía 
Era un poema de amor  para viajar

Quiero estar a tu lado
Quiero mirarte y sentir 
Quiero perderme esperando 
Yo quiero quererte o morir

Te perdí
Y no te perderé
Nunca más te dejare
Te busque  muy lejos de aquí(de aquí)
Te encontré pensando en mí

528,"Twas the night after Christmas and all through the trailer The beer had gone flat and the pizza was staler The tube socks hung empty  no candies or toys I was camped out on my old La-Z-Boy  The kids they weren't talking to me or my wife The worst Christmas they said they had had in their lives My wife couldn't argue and neither could I So I watched TV and my wife  she just cried  When out in the yard the dog started barkin' I stood up and looked and saw Sheriff Larkin He yelled  ""Roy I am sworn to uphold the laws And I got a complaint from a feller named Clause""  I said  ""Clause  I don't know nobody named Clause And you ain't takin me in without probable cause"" Then the Sheriff he said  ""The man was shot at last night"" I said  ""That might've been me  just what's he look like?  The Sheriff replied  ""Well he's a jolly old feller  with a big beer gut belly That shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly He sports a long beard and a nose like a cherry"" I said  ""That sounds like my wife's sister Sherri""  ""It's no time for jokes Roy "" the Sheriff he said ""The man I'm describing is dressed all in red I'm here for the truth now  it's time to come clean Tell me what you done  and tell me what you seen""  Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell It wouldn't be the first time I spent New Years in jail I said  ""Sheriff it happened last night about ten I thought that my wife had been drinking again""  When she walked in from works she was white as a ghost I thought maybe she'd seen one of them UFO's But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head And stopped on the roof of our good neighbor Red  Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shutter A freezer full of venison standing right on Red's gutter Well  my hands were a shaking as I grabbed my gun When outta Red's chimney this feller did run  And slung on his back was this bag overflowin' I thought he'd stolen Red's stuff while old Red was out bowlin' So I yelled  ""Drop it fat boy  hands in the air"" But he went about his business like he hadn't a care  So I popped off a warning shot over his head Well he dropped that bag and he jumped in that sled And as he flew off I heard him extort ""that's assault with intent Roy  I'll see you in court. ""I'll tell you what sheriff if you put a subnet"" On me I won't show up ill hold up in the cellar And you'll never rout me outta there So why don't you just Turn car off come In well watch wrestling eat some Easter bunny stew and talk about howta catch that tooth fairy She's been over here about every other night",'Twas the Night After Christmas,1996,Hip Hop
529,"It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse

The stockings all hung
By the chimney with care
In hopes that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there

The children were nestled
All safe in their beds
While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

And mom in her kerchief
And I in my cap
Had just settled down
For a long winter's nap

When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

Away to the window
I flew like a flash
Tore open the shutters
And threw up the sash

The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow
Gave the lustre of midday
To object below

When what to my wandering eyes
Should appear
But a miniature sleigh
And eight tiny reindeer

With a little ol' driver
So lively and quick
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick

More rapid than eagles
His courses they came
As he whistled and shouted
And called them by name

And quot  now dasher
Now dancer
Now prancer
Now vixen

On comet
On cupid
On doner
An' blitzen' and quot

To the top of the porch
To the top of the wall
Now dash away  dash away
Dash away all

As dry leaves
Before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet with an obstacle
Mount to the sky

So  up to the housetop
The courses they flew
With a sleigh full of toys
And St. Nicholas too

And then in a twinkling
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof

As I drew in my head
And was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas
Came with a bound

He was dressed all in fur
From his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler
Just opening his pack

His eyes how they twinkled
His dimples how merry
His cheeks were like roses
His nose like a cherry

His drawl little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin
Was a white as the snow

The stump of his pipe
He held tight in his teeth
And the smoke it encircled his head
Like a wreath

He had a broad face
And a round little belly
That shook when he laughed
Like a bowl full of jelly

He was chubby and plump
A right jolly old elf
I laughed when I saw him
In spite of myself

A wink of his eye
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word
But went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings
Then turned with a jerk

An' laying a finger
Along side his nose
An' giving a nod
Up the chimney he rose

He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle
An' away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
And quot  Happy Christmas to all
And to all a goodnight and quot

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says  I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very  very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby  that's not what I want
Hurt me  hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Hurt me  hurt me
I know you wanna take me home

And I know we couldn't get any closer
I don't want to act tough  I just want to fall in love
As we move into the night I get crazy
Thinking how it's gonna be with you baby
I don't want to play rough I've been loving you enough
Oh  baby

I want to take forever tonight
Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
I want to take forever tonight
Fill you up  fill you up with love
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes
I want to take forever tonight

Touch my lips  I'm on fire
You're the only one I'll ever desire
Turn the lights down low  make the world go slow
When I'm holding you tonight it's so easy
Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me
And to rush would be a crime
I just want to spend some time with you baby

Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
I want to take forever tonight
Fill you up  fill you up with love
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes
I want to take forever tonight

And when I'm here beside you
I want to see what drives you out of your mind
I never want to leave I only want to be with you

Dear Daddy do the whipperwill still echo through the night? Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light? And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road? I miss you so.  Well years keep slipping by me Like miles out on the road But I don't guess I'll change my way of life There's no harm in holding memories But please tell me if you can If I can bring those old times inside.  Dear Mama can you still find the dipper in the stars? Do the roads still go for hours without cars? Does the frost still shine on the grass outside the door? Just like before Tell me more.  Is Sis still planning marriage sometime soon? Can you still reach out and touch the moon? Do old songs still ring out through the hills for days and days?

That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burnin
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returnin
What else was there for me to do but cry

Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally

Dancing for a living in blue light
You took a glance at me  we overlooked it
My eyes were searching for the secret
As to whether we'd fit and I said

There it will be where we both can see
We'll meet in the Yellow Forest

I caught you once again in your dance act
Your attitude has changed  you smiled at me
Now I can tell where we both should be

Why can't you come see about me? You've got to get in a taxi  subway train Don't make me cry these tears in vain  baby A hundred nights without you is murder baby A 101 just won't do  no!

876,"Gira el haz de luz
Para que se vea desde alta mar
Yo buscaba el rumbo de regreso
Sin quererlo encontrar

Pie detrás de pie
Iba tras el pulso de claridad
La noche cerrada apenas se abría
Se volvía a cerrar

Un faro quieto nada sería
Guía mientras no deje de girar
No es la luz lo que importa en verdad
Son los 12 segundos de oscuridad

Para que se vea desde alta mar
De poco le sirve al navegante
Que no sepa esperar

Pie detrás de pie
No hay otra manera de caminar
La noche del Cabo
Revelada en un inmenso radar

Un faro para sólo de día
Guía mientras no deje de girar
No es la luz lo que importa en verdad
Son los 12 segundos de oscuridad

883,"Tengo tanto miedo de decirte como soy
Todo lo que quiero en una simple decisión
Puede ser que tú me eleves
Yo no sé si tú me quieres

Diecisiete veces fuera de tu habitación
En cada espejo voy viendo el reflejo de mi situación
Yo no sé si tú me entiendes
Pero sé quién eres y sé lo que quieres

Viajo fuera de control
Persiguiendo la salida
Y es que no tengo el valo para decirte adiós

Peligrosamente pierdo la respiración
Se mueve el tiempo en cada momento
Y no hay explicación

Aunque sé muy bien que duele
Yo regreso a verte
No quiero perderte

Viajo fuera de control
Persiguiendo la salida
Y es que no tengo el valor para decirte adiós

887,"Lo nuestro duró
Lo que duran dos peces de hielo
En un güisqui on the rocks
En vez de fingir
O  estrellarme una copa de celos
Le dio por reír
De pronto me vi
Como un perro de nadie
Ladrando  a las puertas del cielo
Me dejó un neceser con agravios
La miel en los labios
Y escarcha en el pelo

Tenían razón
Mis amantes
En eso de que  antes
El malo era yo
Con una excepción
Esta vez
Yo quería quererla querer
Y ella no
Así que se fue
Me dejó el corazón
En los huesos
Y yo de rodillas

Desde el taxi
Y  haciendo un exceso
Me tiró dos besos
Uno por mejilla
Y regresé
A la maldición
Del cajón sin su ropa
A la perdición
De los bares de copas
A las cenicientas
De saldo y esquina

Y  por esas ventas
Del fino laina
Pagando las cuentas
De gente sin alma
Que pierde la calma
Con la cocaína
Volviéndome loco
Derrochando
La bolsa y la vida
La fui  poco a poco
Dando por perdida

Y eso que yo
Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías
Para no comprarla
Con bisutería
Ni ser el fantoche
Que va  en romería
Con la cofradía

Del santo reproche
Tanto la quería
Que  tardé  en aprender
A olvidarla  diecinueve días
Y quinientas noches
Dijo hola y adiós
Y  el portazo  sonó
Como un signo de interrogación
Sospecho que  así
Se vengaba  a través del olvido
Cupido de mi
No pido perdón

¿Para qué? Si me va a perdonar
Porque ya no le importa
Siempre tuvo la frente muy alta
La lengua muy larga
Y la falda muy corta
Me abandonó
Como se abandonan
Los zapatos viejos
Destrozó el cristal
De mis gafas de lejos
Sacó del espejo
Su vivo retrato

Y  fui  tan torero
Por los callejones
Del juego y el vino
Que  ayer  el portero
Me echó del casino
De torrelodones
Qué pena tan grande
Negaría el santo sacramento
En el mismo momento
Que ella me lo mande
Y eso que yo

Paro no agobiar con
Flores a maría
Para no asediarla
Con mi antología
De sábanas frías
Y alcobas vacías

894,"How 'bout a tear for the year of 1960 
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall 
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall 

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble 
That was brewing in the Asian way 
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A. 

In the city of the lost and found 
It's hard to get a break 
Hard to stop from getting turned around 
And make the same mistakes 

My reputation's on the line 
The final day of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso 
I practiced 61 minutes a day 
I could never reach the keys 
But it was all OK 

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother 
That could brighten up the darkest nights 
It's just another sign of love 
Whenever we would fight 

It's all the same twenty years ago 
As it is right now 
Like a tour at the closing show 
When I take my bow 

My reputation's on the line 
At the start of '79 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today 
I've played this part so many times 
Since the end of '59 
But like the sun  just watch me shine 
Today

895,Baby  I'm stuck in the middle  and I don't know why Find the words you sing to be Sweeter than the words of the bird in the sky Oh  the days you came around I feel so good for me I can take most anything Cause what you bring  I find it to be magical I feel like I'm loving you in 1963 Flowers in my hair Little bitty hearts upon my cheek Baby  you'll be on my mind 'Til I kiss you next time  Baby  come on  take a ride in my little blue bug Keep the windows down Don't forget to celebrate the radio's up Oh  the way you hold my hand There is no other way We could take a thousand walks And laugh all day  I find it to be magical I feel like I'm loving you in 1963 Flowers in my hair now Little bitty hearts upon my cheek Baby  you'll be on my mind 'Til I kiss you next time,1963,2004,Hip Hop
896,1965  je m'souviens d'une chanson Et de deux anneaux d'or Que nous portons encore Et d'un petit garçon.  1965  je n'me souviens pas bien Qui de nous deux partait Et la mort de mon chien.  Quelques années plus tard On apprenait un soir Qu'un chêne était brisé  Qu'il n'avait pas plié  Qu'il entrait dans l'histoire.  1900  juste après. Je me souviens très bien La couleur des volets  Les parfums du jardin.  1970  je me souviens d'avril  Une femme aux yeux clairs  Un voyage aux enfers  Une année difficile.  1970  c'est la première fissure  L'avocat  le Palais  Et les lettres d'injures.  1976  c'est la mort de mon père Et cette impression folle Que ses dernières paroles N'étaient pas les dernières.  1980 et les années qui suivent  C'est la fuite en avant  Le combat délirant Des plus forts qui survivent.  C'est la fin d'une histoire  La moitié d'une vie  Vingt années qui s'égarent Et les jours que j'oublie.  1965  je m'souviens d'une chanson Et de deux anneaux d'or Que nous portons encore Et d'un petit garçon.,1965,1995,Hip Hop

The times they are a-telling  and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves  and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw

And tell that you're eighty  but brother  you won't care
You'll be shooting up on everything  tomorrow's never there

Forgive me if it goes astray

Could of sworn it was judgment day

The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere

You know I didn't even care

Party over  oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

So sue me if I go to fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last

And baby he's ready to roar  yeah yeah

Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die here today  uhh
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away

922,"You've gone too far
I'm on my way
You can tell the concierge
To bring around my car
You've gone too far

You said too much
Things you shouldn't say
You can keep your violins
Your sins  your care  your touch
You said too much

Get off the ground now baby
Just shut your mouth and maybe
This can all be done
I won't tell anyone

You showed them all
Things they shouldn't see
You lost the sense
The permanence  the flair  the ball
You showed them all

Well now I know
You take everything
Your car  your cash
Your shoes  your flash
You so and so
Well now I know

And I even think it's funny
Don't say you're sorry  bunny
You can keep the wings
Just let me get my things

You go too far

932,"Pensé que era un buen momento 
Por fin se hacía realidad 
Tanto oír hablar de tu silencio 
Dicen que te arrastra como el mar
Llené de libros mi maleta 
También de fotos tuyas de antes 
Dibujé tu sonrisa junto a la mía 
Me dormí con tu abrigo en el sofá

Quiero estar a tu lado 
Quiero mirarte y sentir 
Quiero perderme esperando 
Yo quiero quererte o morir

Y en el momento que vi tu mirada buscando mi cara 
La madrugada del 20 de enero saliendo del tren 
Me pregunté que sería sin ti el resto de mi vida 
Y desde entonces te quiero  te adoro y te vuelvo a querer

Cogí un tren que no dormía 
Y vi tu cara en un cristal 
Era un reflejo del sol de mediodía 
Era un poema de amor  para viajar

Quiero estar a tu lado
Quiero mirarte y sentir 
Quiero perderme esperando 
Yo quiero quererte o morir

Te perdí
Y no te perderé
Nunca más te dejare
Te busque  muy lejos de aquí(de aquí)
Te encontré pensando en mí

En el momento que vi tu mirada buscando mi cara 
La madrugada del 20 de enero saliendo del tren 
Me pregunté que sería sin ti el resto de mi vida 
Y desde entonces te quiero  te adoro y te vuelvo a querer",20 de Enero,2003,Hip Hop

I just gotta bring it to they attention dirty  that's all

You better watch who you talkin bout  runnin your mouth  like you know me
You gon' f*ck around and show why the ""Show Me"" get called the ""Show Me""
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France  but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats  total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compare this  my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola  no service  out of your range
You out of your brains  thinkin' I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss  still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin' bitchin' and cryin suck it up as a loss
'Cause your  acts is wack  your whole label is wack
And matter fact  eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I am  number one  no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey
I  am  number one ey ey  ey ey
Now let me ask you man
What does it take to be  number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (ey)
What does it take to be  number one?
Ey ey  ey ey

Do you like it when I shake it for ya  daddy?
Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?

Hell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn
Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say  she say  did he say
What I think he said? Squash that  he probably got that off eBay
Or some  Internet access some  website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine  don't wind up on the flat line
Oh if my uncle could see me know
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties  comin' askin  ""Yo where the party?""
Oh lordy  will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi  got me thinkin fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know  PIMP

I am  number one  no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it ey
I  am  number one ey ey  ey ey
And tell me now der
What does it take to be  number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (ey)

Aiyyo I'm tired of people judgin what's real Hip-Hop
Half the time you be them niggas who f*ckin album flop
You know! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
C'mon! Mad 'cause I'm hot  he just  mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props  just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks  and keep my fans comin' in flocks
'Til you top the Superbowl  keep your mouth on lock
Shh
I'm awake
I'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin' for granted blessin' e'rything on my life
Tryin' to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak the truth
I heat the booth  Nelly actin' so uncouth (so crazy)
Top down shirt off in the coupe  spreadin' the loot
With my family and friends  and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win dirty  dity

I  am  number one

And all the ladies was  scream  screamin' out loud
Go number 1
Brian  Baby  Bizzy  Bubba
Go number 1
Old ig-nant motherf*cker

Verse 1: (Baby)
(Come on  you ridin' this dick)
Yo  f*ck being a prince
I'm the king of the south
It's the birdman daddy stick the gag in ya mouth
It's the  Boss Hog  known Big Dawg
The boss of the ghetto and I ball like a Dawg
You see that  four pound  ga-round  and round
round banana clip and I shut your hood down
See I floss like Jewelry (stay broke like Woodie)
It's the number 1 daddy  look for carpet and pully
See I shine like feet  23's for me
24's on the truck and leave on dub streets
See I wipe a bitch down
Then dribble on the hoe
And touch her from her head  from her waist to her toe
Now buckle up Ma it's time to ride out
G-waggin' daddy   I keeps it down south
Escalade truck  in the back  and it's nasty
Cut it on the side  switch it out  and it's a Caddy

Chorus(2x)

Verse 2: (Mannie Fresh)
Let me holla at these niggas that went out bad
They jumped in the magazine and showed they ass
But it ain't nothin' but stunna to bust a nigga ass
When I jumped off the porch  y'all were still on the grass (Biotch)
Nigga gave me a shot and gave me a gun
Fresh loaded the gun and told me have some fun
But A A- the be	-I the I-I

The ???  the Lui  the Gucci  the berry
The swine  the mink  let's get it together
The prowler  the swade  the jacket  the leather
Headliner  rebot  tailor made sweaters
The guns  the pistol  automatic niggas
Ak  nine glocks   mackin' left niggas
It's the princess cuts  round shaped diamonds
You betta understand because these hoes all minors (You better Biotch!)
It's the Ma- Ma- Mannie Mannie Fresh nigga (The f*ck with this nigga!)

Spin yo block on 24's nigga
Woman: Stunna Stunna
Mannie: I'm known to havin' hoes nigga!

Chorus

Verse 3 :
I went from  teach to streets  to solvin' this beef
Nigga gave me my shot   November the nuts ski
Aye aye 19 that is (Woooo)
See them tattoo tears
See I'm a known deep boy with the dope in the frig
It's me Lac and Stone and all my kids
Ridin' round town in that brand new Jig (Woooooo Weeeee!)
Jaguar that is
See I'm world wide grindin' and I'm tryin' to live
You know how it is when you  got the kids
You gots to go home and get it how you live
Ain't got no money so you pick at eye lids
Turn around the corner and you askin' why
You fought everybody cause you stupid ass high
Asked mom for money you dumb motherf*cka (f*cka)
She find out in jail and you back this summa (summa)

Drop the tank then I shine more

Put it in the pot  then I whip it with my eyes closed

Stop  check the watch like tell me where time go

S'all you got?
That's all you got?

I don't put glue sticks in my nose and um
But my face pasted to linoleum
Kitchen floor shit
Some college dorm shit

Face down in a bloodstained carpet
Get chicks at the farmers' market
White girls buy produce
Take them home  make them drink Grey Goose

White boy wasted
Glue stick pasted
White boy wasted
Glue stick pasted
Stupid faceded

I drink a can of Sparks and try to freestyle
Ex-girlfriend's on speed dial
Oh that's a drunk dial  drunk sexting
Drunk stagger  drunk swagger

I don't rap good  it don't matter
Can't sing good  it don't matter
Cause I'm blacked out sleepwalking
On a quest for God at my friend's apartment

Super Soaker filled with Four Loker
Plus SoCo  real gross yo
I go ham and cheese on rolls
That's a metaphor. Another metaphor:

Like icing on a Cinnabon
Like a hot chick that ain't no fun
Listen  I'ma teach you a lesson
Let's start at number

One: Sleep is the best way to save money
Two: Money is the best way to have sex
Three: Sex is the best way to feel nothing
Four: Nothing happens if you're asleep

Before I think about coming to cribs  I be lugging my glitz so big
On the waist it be rubbing my ribs  it's very dangerous f*ckin' with this

I been doublin' chips holdin' my own with the chrome double-grips
Up in the mix  caught a couple of vics when I used to fight
But I ain't been scufflin' since this is as tough as it gets

Come on  lights  cameras  action it's on
Straight outta gate with another hot song
Keepin' it real though gonna last long
Break out the stiletto coming mad strong

Bounce if you wanna  lounge will play the corner
I'm New York talking that gangster talk
Twenty-four bases  queue to the oasis
Suspicious see eyes and no faces

Been there  years just put in to work
For the dough  so you know that I couldn't get jerked
Street mental  throw on the hoodie then lurk
In the rental until the end of the earth

Always cooking up the new hot seller
Putting that money in the bank like the teller

In 2000 new car  new house and
Buy the whole store up  style I'm too pro  son
Get even more buck wild  I draw crowds and

In every state I still draw them at every forum
Don't lose no points I just score them
And count blessings at the top of my freshness
Live  get it right this is not no job

Today or tomorrow it doesn't matter
Got the stages moving on up the ladder
And stay grounded  remember the Bronx 'cause they founded
Cutting them old joints up by James Brown  kid

Golden  'fore I forget hold it
Got to shout out the block  four-fifth Holden
And Jamaica  Queens I'm true to the fort
Every day  all day not new to the sport

In Elisabeth  kids in Queens is who I feast with
When I ain't in the lab flipping beats with
Drums to pound  I be breaking it down
With homeboy Van on the way uptown  how that sound

It's 'bout that time  it's 'bout that time

There's a whole lot of rappers in the world today
Some good  there is some that got nothing to say
Some fake  some false  some imitation
But I'm the uncut raw for your generation

Work magic with terms like never before
Hang them rappers live  leave their head on the floor
Drop hits for the hip hop crowd that rock kicks and hats
Crisped jeans and whips to match

Hardcore system up on blast
Cock  dip and stash live now and forget the past
In the streets try to hustle while eating a meal
Watching out so you don't get beaten in the grill

'Cause the crossroads is deep  sleep and you will
Be the next one up  I'm feeding the real
So get eardrums son  start heating the drill
One time and this is what y'all feel and I'ma still be

995,[B-Real talking] A lot of a  sharks out there  try'na take a bite of somethin' What's hot Lot of chameleons out there  try'na change up Anytime somethin' new comes along  everybody wants a bite Don't happen overnight  [Chorus] So you want to be a rock superstar?  And live large  A big house. Five cars  You're in charge.  Comin' up in the world.  Don't trust nobody got to look over your shoulder constantly  I remember the days when I was a young kid growing up Looking in the mirror  dreaming about blowin' up  The rock crowds. Make money. Chill with the honeys.  Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me. Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest  And the games that be comin' with it  Nevertheless  you got to go for the gusto  But you don't know about the blood  sweat  and tears and  Losin' some of your peers.  And losin' some of yourself to the years past  gone by  Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy  Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act  Shit's deep  48 track studio gangsta mack sign the deal  Think he's gonna make a mil but never will  'Til he crosses over  still  Fillin' your head with fantasies  Come with me  Show the sacrifice it takes to make the G's   You want to be a rock superstar in the biz  And take shit from people who don't know what it is  I wish it was all fun and games  But the price of fame is high  And some can't pay the way  Feel trapped in What you rappin' about?  Tell me what happened when you lost clout?  The route you took started collapsing  No fans. No fame. No respect. No change. No women and Everybody shits on your name.   [Chorus: x2]  People see rock stars  you know what I'm sayin'? But you still try to get out  More like everybody else  you know  its a fun job  but its still a job. There's  Gonna be another cat comin' out  Looking like me  sounding like me next year. I know this. It'll be a flipside  Tell what you did someone trying to spin off like some circus.  You ever have big dreams? Or makin' big cream?  Big shot  heavy hitter on the mainstream  You want to look trendy in the Bentley  Be a star band  never act friendly.  You want to have big fame  Let me explain what happens to these stars and their big brains  First they get played like all damn day  Long as you sell everything will be ok  Then you get dissed by the media and fans  Things never stay the same way they began  I heard that some never get fooled to the fullest  That's why fools end up dining on a bullet  Think everything's fine in the big time  See me in my Lex with the chrome ray shine  So you roll far and live large  It ain't all that goes with being a rock star  [Chorus: x2]  My own son don't know me  I'm chillin' in a hotel room  lonely  But I thank God I'm with my homies  But sometimes I wish I was back home  But only no radio or video's gonna show me no love  They're phony  Got to hit the road solely so the record gets pushed by Sony  I'm in the middle like Monie  And the press say that my own people disown me  The best way back to keep your head straight  Never inflate the cranium  They're too worried about them honeys at the Palladium  Who just want to cling on  swing on  and so on  Go on fall off - the ho's fall off  To the next rock superstar with no shame  Give him a year and they'll be right out the game  The same as the last one who came before him  Gained fame started getting' ignored  I warned him  Asured him this ain't easy  Take it from the weazy  Sleazy people want to be so cheesy  They're f*cking evil  Assassins  assassins  [Chorus: x2],(Rock) Superstar,2000,Hip Hop

Readin' my rights and shit  it's all junk Pullin' out a silly club  so you stand With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand But take off the gun so you can see what's up And we'll go at it  punk  and I'ma f*ck you up! Make you think I'ma kick your ass But drop your gat  and Ren's gonna blast I'm sneaky as f*ck when it comes to crime But I'm a smoke 'em now and not next time Smoke any motherf*cker that sweats me Or any asshole that threatens me I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope Takin' out a cop or two  they can't cope with me The motherf*ckin' villain that's mad With potential to get bad as f*ck So I'ma turn it around Put in my clip  yo  and this is the sound Yeah  somethin' like that But it all depends on the size of the gat Takin' out a police would make my day But a nigga like Ren don't give a f*ck to say  F*ck the police F*ck the police F*ck the police F*ck the Police  ""Yeah man  what you need?""  ""Police  open now""  ""Aww shit""  ""We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em""  ""What the f*ck did I do  man  what did I do?""  ""Just shut the f*ck up And get your motherf*ckin' ass on the floor""  ""But I didn't do shit""  ""Man  just shut the f*ck up!""  ""Eazy-E  won't you step up to the stand And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?""  I'm tired of the motherf*ckin' jackin' Sweatin' my gang  while I'm chillin' in the shack  and Shinin' the light in my face  and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt I kick ass  or maybe 'cause I blast On a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger Of an Uzi or an AK 'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say They put out my picture with silence 'Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior Yeah  I'm a gangsta  but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge  what do ya got? A sucker in a uniform waitin' to get shot By me or another nigga And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger (Size ain't shit  he's from the old school  fool) And as you all know  E's here to rule Whenever I'm rollin'  keep lookin' in the mirror And ears on cue  yo  so I can hear a Dumb motherf*cker with a gun And if I'm rollin' off the 8  he'll be the one That I take out  and then get away While I'm drivin' off laughin'  this is what I'll say  F*ck the police F*ck the police F*ck the police F*ck the Police  ""The verdict The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck White bread  chicken shit motherf*cker""  ""But wait  that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!""  ""Get him out of here!""  ""I want justice!""  ""Get him the f*ck out my face!""  ""I want justice!""  ""Out  right now!""  ""F*ck you  you black motherf*ckers!""

Finally Famous nigga

I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10  then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

All this bread can't be good for my cholesterol
Don't come round' talking loudly  f*cking up my repertoire dawg
I can't lie bruh lately I've been stressing heavily
I'm sipping  popping  smoking on whatever take the pressure off
Diss you  FF Imperial 'til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti f*ck boy material 'til I'm dead  I'm living proof
If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral
It's gone  word  boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I'm bringing home dead prez  my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back  right along with my garments
Went to sleep  snoring

I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10  then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook  one clean  the other PMS'ing  no hable ingles
If police have questions they don't know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon' pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil 'cause thought the fair was here
Like oh  I'm primo  top spot redeemed ho  for who  my team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica  Montego  pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the f*ck I need to sleep for?

Bitch  I do what I do  I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rise  got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her  for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill  but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase  every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
Good music or die ho  shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes  shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than day-day  no off day just pay day
Boy  since I was a bae-bae I swear was OG  you was a no G
Texting these hoes that you love 'em and shit  prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG  bitch  I'd still be more G
F*ck you know about night terrors  nightmares and night scares
About not getting that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped control just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed  yep  changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearing the same clothes
Going to the same club  taking the same pose
Pillow talking with the same hoes
All day about how find 'em and Hov hit the same hoes
Some niggas never grew up until they grew old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
F*ck with me and you'll destroy fool
End up on the f*cking Detroit news  better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters  I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm  Caesar had Brutus
F*ck am I saying  Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright thought if I just got you  bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend  I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek  me and her dick to chin

Some call it tricking cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherf*cking die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you f*cked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Coming through and I don't f*ck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna f*ck a nigga
Good chance she done f*cked a nigga
Turned around and said f*ck that nigga
Stack on my belt  double M we a cult

I've been held from ten to tens  swear I won't sin again
Bring the Hell to my residence  godly presence with presidents
My day job  it made me shit  public housing ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense  niggas whole home invaded quick
I did work  I done pay my dues  I'm induced  now I'm overdue
One hit one  call this voodoo  don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain  one problem  plus the issues  I can't solve them
But it's nothin'  and I'm still in the club on the couch still f*ckin' up somethin'
Nigga please! Mama please  I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred  shit
Scratch that  'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write
Did songs with Hov  now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy

Ten ways to a G
One situation - pay attention to me

[children] Ten!
[Fresh]    Tell a broad  ""Everything for free.
           You can shop 'til you drop  shorty  all on me.""
[children] Nine!
[Fresh]    Number ten ain't nothin' but a lie
           Don't buy the broad nothin'  and I'm 'bout to tell you why
[children] Eight!
[Fresh]    Sell the skank a dream bigger than life
           And she gon' stick around for the shoppin' spree  alright

           you'll make my fantasies come true
           And if she say  ""What it is?"" - 
           To sleep with your sister and you
[children] Two!
[Fresh]    Don't love these (?) - love yourself
           And if you pay attention to this you'll have plenty of wealth
[children] One!
[Fresh]    I'm done  and I ain't got nothin' else to say

I gave you three situations
And ten ways to deal with it
You see what I'm sayin'
If you apply that to your everyday-life
whether you slingin'  you dig
Ballin'
Or playin' on broads
You  too  can be scraped
I said scraped - that's right - scraped
See what I'm sayin'
And these (?)
I mean  we gotta get together - marry yourself  man
'cause ain't nobody gon' care 'bout yourself but yourself
Know what I'm sayin'
Go marry yourself  go on a honeymoon - treat yourself
I mean  'cause can't nobody cheat on theyself
You gon' be with yourself  but you can't cheat on yourself
You know what I'm sayin'
Man  that's ballerrific
Stuntastic
And I like to say one more time: good night
Mmm-hmm
And tell myself  ""Self  I am so enfatuated with you.""

Yo  yo  yo   My style of rhymin is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans  Because I recognize its all about timin'  Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science  In front of 20 ft. bonfires lookin' skyward   Calculating May 5  2000 the nine planets'll be in alignment  The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit  Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet  With mercury ion rockets   And a big ass ""Canibus comin soon"" poster on the side of it  I'm known geographically and intergalactically  That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me  They even tried kidnappin' me   And they would've snatched me  If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity  Engines stalled and failed. Crashed into a farmer's field  And that's really what caused Roswell   Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12  Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal  Lyrically I'm off scale  So all hail or get tossed towards Hell  whatever y'all feel   Briusin' niggas  confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens  Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles  Hear the wild wolf growl  Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds   Wack niggas want to be down but its not allowed  Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth  With the southpaw southern fist  I'll bust your shit. Swell your lip and get the Bubba shrimp   Back the tougher shit. What a wimp  You giant Goliath. Niggas get shot with a rubber sling  I'm an experiment gone bad.  My brainwave's on an ????? graph. Yo  I'm stark ravin mad   Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast  When I throw the ????? flask in my hand  Flammable liquids in the lab explode  And you get stabbed with all the flyin glass   Trained to blow up commercial aircrafts  Trained in chemical weapons class  Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last  I put him in a leather mask   Spray his ass with a can of ???? gas  Then watch him grab his neck and gag  Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh  ""You want to battle?"" is the type of question you should never ask   Nigga  pick a tougher task. See who the f*ck'll last  Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass  You need to recognize  My hand is quicker than the eye   Quicker than the 5 speed Jamiroquai drives  A lifespan longer than 9 lives. Infinite rhymes that can't die  A nigga with a divine mind  I dedicate this to the wise. Dedicate it to dames   Dividin' myself into 100 ten times  You can't deny the offering's an offer  Flows that glow with aurora's the spark of light  Water fly like a saucer  With the torque of a Porsche  Murder a million MCs then autograph all of their coffins  Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'm a live long   And I'm a be gettin' it on till I'm gone  Look at all the stages I been on. All the songs that I spit on  I took an oath to rip everything I get on  A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndromes   In the wristbones from grippin' microphones this long  I'm just a small fish in a big pond  And gets pissed off whenever I gets picked on  Nigga try to flip and get flipped on   My army march a million strong  Like the nation of Islam with suede timbs on  Extremely hostile  Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles   A lyrical lynch mob  Shittin' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on  Duckin' down low like Vietnam fightin' the Vietcong  Screamin' ""incomin'"" when I see a bomb   Speak to your leader. Surrender your arms  You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds  Plus 800 000 to even consider a war  And 200 000 more to even look hard   You better drop your flag and withdraw  My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors  And smash y'all. Attach y'all to the back of my horse  And drag y'all across the motherf*ckin' asphalt   9 out of 10 niggas is frauds  You know who you are always talkin' about your bitches and your cars  Your jewelry and your girls. It's like we from two different worlds  You motherf*ckers really get on my nerves   'Cause I'm beyond them  on some futuristic cyborg shit  I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what picture crossed in  Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience  To barbecue your brain organs   You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven  I flame broil suckers and hit 'em with some more shit  The raw shit. Call my reinforcements  the four horsemen  Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit   I dare a motherf*cker to cross it  I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin  Tell him it's important. Tell him to call Sting 3 way and sing a   [Chorus]  Break your camcorders so you motherf*ckers can't record it  Call the news  I'll kill your reporters  Start a lawsuit  I'll kill your lawyers  F*ck the soft shit and f*ck what y'all think   My album's gold cause my album was the bomb  shit  Y'all niggas got your ass beat cause you asked for it  Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid  'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys   You f*ck 'em in the ass  then you give 'em cash for it  That's some sick shit homeboy  A hundred years ago  they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud  You fraudulent. Feminine. Fragile as a feather is   With an effortless blow  I'll crack your whole skeleton  You think you're better than Canibus  where's the evidence?  You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship  You need to shut the f*ck up cause your breath stink   Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints  Battlin' me you never win  You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in?

We haven't spotted them yet But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity  A 100 miles and runnin Mc Ren  I hold the gun and You want me to kill a muther f**ker and it's done in. Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct - Is one of the main reasons I don't give a f**k. Chances are usually not good Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood. And getting' jacked by the you-know-who. When in a black and white the capacity is two. We're not alone  we're three more brothers  I mean street-brothers. Now wearin'  my dyes  'cause I'm not stupid  muther f**kers. They're out to take our heads  for what we said in the past. Point blank - they can kizz my black azz. I  didn't stutter when I said ""f**k tha police"". Cause it's hard for a nigga to  get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. Cause police and little black  niggas don't mix so  Now I'm creepin' Through the fall. Runnin' Like a team. Well  see  I might have slayed y'all. So  for now pack the gun and Hold it in the air. ?cause mc ren has a 100 miles of  runnin  ""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run."" ""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed"" ""100 miles to their home base  Compton.""  Lend me a muther f**kin' ear. So I can tell you why...  Runnin' With my brothers  headed for the home base. With a steady pace on the face that just we raced. The road ahead goes on and on. The shit is getting' longer than the muther f**kin' marathon. Runnin' on but  never runnin' out. Stayin' wired and if I get tired  I can still try out.  Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do. But nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta  attitude.  Confused. Yo  but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose. One of the few who's been  accused and abused Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. But you don't know  shit til you been in my shoes. And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some  shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that  disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard  hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for  havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the  FBI's all over my dick.  Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's  when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and  yo  it's a  long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah   back to Compton again. Yo  it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas  been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my  muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but   yo  I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough. Just like Carl  Lewis I'm bailin' the f**k out. from city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.  Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm A straight up nigga that's done  in  gunnin' and comin' Straight at yo ass. A 100 miles and runnin'  This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton. You're almost there  but the FBI has a little message for you: ""nowhere to run  to  baby. Nowhere to hide."" Good luck brothers.  Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose. Show me on the news but I hate to be abused. I know it was a set-up. So now I'm gonna get up. Even if the FBI wants me to shut up. But I've got 10 000 niggas strong. They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song. And while they treat my group like dirt  Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts. So I'mma run til I can't run no more. 'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score. I got a urge to kick down doors. At my grave like a slave even if the ren calls.  Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'. Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherf**ker's are ridin' Started with five and  yo  one couldn't take it. So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it. The number's even - now I'm leavin'. We're never getting' took by a bitch with a weave in. Her and the troops are right behind me. But they're so f**kin' stupid  they'll never find me.  One more mile to go through the dark streets. Runnin' like a mutherf**ker on my own two feet. But you know I never stumble or lag last. I'm almost home so I better haul ass. Tearin' up everything in sight. It's a little crazy mutherf**ker dodging the searchlight. Now that chase  the shit  is done and Four mutherf**kers goin' crazy with A 100 miles of runnin' Stop! stop! stop! stop!

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses  leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle  watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though  there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

I'll be back for all y'all...",12,1995,Hip Hop

We at it again

Ok  I got my bathin' apes  check  outfit  check
No need to iron  might need to iron
Wit these jewels on  it?s likely they'll be iron
Ask mami dancin' beside me if she ridin'

Or what she sippin' on  mink got my fitted on
She somethin' vivid on  we came to get it on
Came to get it on  drink a lil' here
Everybody throw a drink in the air
It's goin' down  come on

I stepped in da party like whoa
What's da deal wit it? Ain't no hands in da air unless it's a drink wit it
Honeys lovin' 'cus they know I rock da bells in here
Thugs wit me 'cus they know I roll wit Kells and dem

Then I spot mami shakin' like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a jelly bean
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
And I'm glad I brought my ass to the right party

Ooh  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all f*cked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts  ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no going home  the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body  it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

Stack my chips  make dem hits and
I can tell that y'all love my shit
And got my shirt off  wit my Timbs on
Here all night so you know it's going on

Mami shake it like a tambourine
Wanna eat it just like a tangerine
Mami's givin' me all these nasty dreams
Glad I brought my ass to the right party tonight

Ooh  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all f*cked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts  ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home  the doors is all locked up
Don't nobody move ya body  it's a lockout
So everybody join da party

No more excuses  now in the two doors exclusive
And everything is all inclusive
We can do it all if my boys included
On da phone wit her friends invite 'em all  let's do this

Get things juicy  it's more than enough room in da jacuzzi
For you to lose the feeling of a groupie
Leave ya dude lose the feeling of a hoopty
New Kells playing feelin' on yo' booty

Keys to the Ferrar  leave in the garage
Starts wit a massage  ends wit ménage
Ends in me gettin' da skins to some DeBarge
Just 'cus she tellin' her friends it was garbage

Four a.m.  gotta a babe on the cell
Five a.m.  on my way to the tel
But then around six  same thing  different chick
XL mag  perfect fit  now to the bridge  let's go

Baby showin' me all these crazy things
Got me nibblin' on her belly ring
'Bout to get into the swing of things
She keep rubbin' againist my swinga thing

We off up in the other room so hot
Shorty's about to take off that pink tank top
All I wanna say is  shorty drop it like it's hot
(Drop it like it's hot  drop it like it's hot)

Ooh  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Drinks in da club and now we all f*cked up
DJ keeps spinnin' da cuts  ladies drop it like it's hot
'Cus we up in here tonight

Whoo  it's twelve o'clock and we partyin'
Ain't no goin' home  the doors is all locked up

Welcome female is in my arms.   Overwhelmed by my playboy charms  We jumped in the ride rushed to the crib  I ain't gotta explain what we did  Built to last I simply waxed that   Ax the question  no need for guessin'  Hey baby  how old are you?  21 24 maybe 22   I'm twenty five   She shucked and kinda neeghed   And said  ""hee  hee  hee I'm only 13""   13!!

(Man her brothers will beat you )   GOOD!!   (Even if I get beat down it was still)   GOOD!!

I think it's time that I went home""   She called her pops and said  ""Come get me I'm all alone   I'm sorry daddy I slept with an older man""   He said  ""Don't worry. The 45 is in my hand.   I'll be there before you count to four.""   One two three four   He's at my door   She said  ""See what you did you caused me all this grief.   Your goin' to jail my daddy's a police chief.   If I can't have you no one will.   And I ain't even on the pill.""   But you was   Chorus: Repeat 6x   GOOD!!   Daddy walked in and the whole scene kinda changed   He grabbed his daughter and almost beat the girl insane   She's cryin' down the hall and now goin' home   He closed the door and  ""I'm happy we're all alone   Jump on the bed and look me straight into my eyes   I think your kinda cute  don't make me use my 45""   Daddy's lookin' for a lubricant   He pulled out a little piece of gum and started chemwin' it   He said  ""For year I've been lookin for a big strong man   I've got an apartment out in Brooklyn   Only my daughter and I live there   You can see my daughter anytime  anywhere   But it's you that I want to be mine   The price tag is your behind   Don't worry it'll be   Chorus:   GOOD!!

Naci un dia de junio
Del año 77
Planeta mercurio
Y el año de la serpiente
Sin o patente
Tatuado y en mi frente
Que en el vientre de mi madre
Marcaba el paso siguiente
Me hace llorar
Sin anestesia en la camilla
Mi padre solo dijo es Ana Maria
Si seria el primer llanto
Que me probaría
Quemando las heridas
Y dándome la batería
Solía ser entonces como un libro abierto
Pero leí la letra pequeña del texto
Como un arquitecto
Construyendo cada efecto
Correcto  incorrecto  sé aprender todo al respecto
Saber que algunas personas
Queran el daño
Subir peldaño
Toma tiempo toma año
Con mi peluche mirando lo cotidiano
Dibujos transformaban
Y el invierno en gran verano
Papa me regalo bajo mi insistenso
Juego  trataba de culparte y recibencia
Pero en el cartu hicieron la competencia
Y fue cuando senti mi primera impotencia

1977 no me digan no

Todo lo que cambia lo hará diferente
En el año que nació la serpien

Mi adolescencia
Fue una etapa bizarra
El cuerpo es batería
Y la cabeza guitarra
La orquesta narronato
Nada quebrada para la mirada
De una niña que solo talla espadas
Hormona disparada
Sobre poblada sin formas
En que cambian temporadas
Caminas en crucijadas
Cada cual es su morada
Preparaba la carnada
La sagrada diablada
De mirada encabronada
Mi fila la verdad
Nunca busco su silla
Mi búsqueda fue mero
Proceso de pura pila
Pupila de poeta
Que marco nuestra saliba
En la cordillera que miraba la salida
La parada militar de paso monótono
Colores policromolos
Uniformes de poco tono
Detono mi cuestionamento
La voz si sonó no
Mi primera rima que sonó
Y me enrrolo
Mi búsqueda no fue para mi cosa de escenario
Fue algo necesario
Que marcaba ya mi fallo
Así que todas
Mas de lo necesario
Fue cuando entendí
Que todos quieren ser corsario

I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life 'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife But then again I think I`ll spare ya 'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya See I`m the holder of the key  Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me  I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins  They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t Gonna make it and then end up a statistic My life was twisted I almost missed it The chance yes the chance to make you feel good I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me And the nation of Islam has my support  'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost And the 5 percent nation takes other steps To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps And in the prison they give the brothers new visions Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream Of a total different scene I dress clean  stand lean  Say what I mean and I`m out Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout  [Chorus]  For right now yo my religion is rhyming Perfect timing test the flow and climb in Ansaar  Sunnite  Sheite  Jihad All must regard the times are hard Unite or perish Is the message I cherish That goes for my people of all religions If we`re all black why have so many divisions Superficial factors are drawing us apart  Don`t let it happen Let`s put some respect back in So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one And I just might have one  Or two or maybe even three or four And plus an army of 100 or more But violence is never my first choice I come in peace to release the effect of my voice  [Chorus],2 Deep,1992,Hip Hop

1098,It's obvious  that you got it goin on And I'm contemplating I'm curious  it you mean what you say when you say it And if you're serious about what you want to do 'Cause I have to be honest with you I'm not into you Casanovas  telling me what I want to hear Just so they can get over And after they get what they want  they're done But I been there and done that But you don't really seem like that You're just so cool  and it just seems  [Chorus:] Too good to be true What you say what you do So I gotta be careful Don't want to fall too soon And if I come across sometimes being rude It's nothing against you It just seems  too good to be true  I'd love for us to keep doing things together But I don't want to rush the feeling (don't want to rush the feeling) We can take our time (our time) I really don't mind Besides I gotta know  what you waitin' for 'Cause I don't need no Casanova  telling me what I want to hear Just so you can get over And after you get what you want  you're done But I been there and done that But you don't really seem like that You're just so cool  and it just seems  [Chorus]  Tell me if we stay together In a month will you break it off? I've seen it happen to so many others And I'd rather not Go through that heartache,2 Good 2 Be True,2002,Hip Hop

As I'm rollin' down the block
A player gotta beep
That said ""I want to f*ck""
A two way freak
Her name is Rhonda Peary
Who works at the dairy
Her chewin' is da bomb
But her face looks scary
I'm pushin' down the street
Tryin' to make it to her house
And then I gotta beep from my freak named Minnie Mouse
They call her Minnie Mouse
She live a couple trees
She eat a lot of cheese
If you hit she'll squeak

Dog that's a no  no
Get yo stuff you gotta go
Scrollin' threw my two way is like scrollin' threw my cash flow

Askin' can you get a beep
Hell naw  not at all
You'll be dat dude dat'll make me throw my junk into the wall

It's goin' down
Not now but right now
By now you know the sound
It's dilation  cats with 20/20

I tell nickel and dimers try not to be dealers
If they deal at least help  try not to be villains
And if they caught dealin'  try not to be squealers
If they do try not to be shocked to see killers

Yeah  I'm crazy eyes killer  triple optic
Cold man go Guerrilla  pure with no filler
Rakaa's that real-I  bend steal at will
Eyes open  wide awake  y'all keep your eyes peeled

I never ratted  just rat-a-tat-tatted
Fully automatic  you're whole aura shattered
I got beats and rhymes  either or it never mattered
Flow fast or slow like I did on  ""Eyes Have It""

I don't waste days away glued to John Madden
So when the sun sets West  I ain't mad at it
I gravitate towards those cats who ain't dramatic
And seein' 20/20 money stacks is a habit

Yeah  hindsight is 20/20  let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20  a toast to the past
But here's to the future  20/20

Last couple years shit been off the wall
Many tears lost my mom I'm stayin' strong
Regroup myself  dust my shoulder off
We back once again then poof we gone

I seen shit go down like Alc' almost die
Now I see why they say it's safer to fly
In the same breath  breathe life accept death
Until then 20/20  one of the best yet

I've had experiences that were out of body
Cops still probably clocked me comin' out of parties
I've seen scandalous verdicts make Los Angeles uprise
Black Tail bottoms and Cannabis Cup highs

Create to Devestate taught me how to bomb
From Radiotron  to the German autobahn
Trade money still different color and shade bills
20/20 wide awake y'all keep your eyes peeled

It's goin' down
Not now but right now
By now you know the sound
It's dilation  cats with 20/20

Yeah  hindsight is 20/20  let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20  a toast to the past
But here's to the future  20/20

Three eyes wide  I can still see Ali
Say I float like a butterfly  sting like a bee
Now I float like a brother's high  swing like a beast
I'm from Mid-City  when the bell rings I'm released

Hustlin'  fightin' and eatin' still bringin' relief
To my people  if they're in your reach  each one teach
Runnin' through so much grass my shoes need cleats
Got that ""Vente Vente"" pumpin' through these streets

Last LP was odd  the score's even at last
Now we got enough trees to make you take 4 and pass
Now we got enough in fact don't even pass that back
It's free weed on me  you can hold me to that

When you see me in the streets  it be for that 20/20
Better than diesel  better than kush  it ain't funny
But trust me this Cali  my block's best product
We so quick to cop  Dilated Peoples got 'em

Yeah  hindsight is 20/20  let's toast to the past
But here's to the future time to split this money money
Hindsight is 20/20  a toast to the past

Knock a nigga unconscious and talk shit

With the one-two  one-two shot to the chin
Knock you out like ten shots of vodka and gin

Before dog fightin' and aerial strikes

1134,21 Concepts  I wrote a song about a fetus named Cletus who tried To run for governor before he died He lived in California but traveled worldwide It was a big huge hit! Just kidding I lied There's the song about the 90's  I sampled Ace of Base But kept it off the album in the interest of taste “Cheyenne Rock City ” a song about touring But rhymes about Wyoming are really very boring As for the Churchill song  give me a break! How many songs about England could my listeners take? There was a track about women and the drama they bring “Hot Girls Make Guys Do Really Stupid Things” Remember “Geeked Out”? You don't but I do  “The geek shall inherit the Earth ” it's true! I rapped about nerds being cooler than jocks But if I wanted biased news  I would have just watched Fox  CHORUS I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb But when I laid them down in ProTools They all came out wrong!  “Las Vegas Invasion” was a sci-fi track About aliens addicted to playing blackjack I wrote a song about a kid who made his own flick But got a bad review in Ranger Rick I didn't want to get lynched or punched in mouth So I didn't do that song making fun of the South I did a song about how girls at Stanford are whack Called “College Is Where Girls Go to Get Fat” There was the KRS slash Nirvana debut But the mash-up thing was so 2002 I did an anti-Bush track  and then I did five more But “Rock Against Bush” was so 2004 I wrote a song about China  how could I go wrong? I rapped in Cantonese about Mao Zedong It went um goy  neh ho ma? Nehih sik ying mun ma?  CHORUS I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son I've got CD-R of tracks I once thought would be tight But when I played it for my girl I slept alone that night!  Write a song about a can that gets crushed a lot Write a dental hygiene jam that says  “brush a lot” Write a Bill O'Reilly track that says “hush” a lot No I'm not a player I like Rush a lot!  CHORUS I've got 21 concepts but a single ain't one “If you're still referencing Jay Z I feel bad for you son” So what's the secret to hip-hop  jazz  blues and rock? Step one get out a pad and kill your writer's block… start! I've got 21 concepts but a hit ain't one If you're having lyric problems I feel bad for you son I've got a list of songs here I once thought were the bomb But when I laid them down in ProTools They all came out wrong!,21 Concepts,2006,Hip Hop

1145,I want you to ask yourself one question If you had twenty four hours to live  what would you do?   That's some deep shit right there  a lot of pressure How would you handle it? Mase  what would you do?  Yo  I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal I'd even look for my dad that I never knew And show him how I look in my Beretta  too I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto Show them what they could have if they never settle Take every white kid from high class level Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto Teach niggas how to spend  stack the rest Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress Give every bum on the street cash to invest And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request  Yo  yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket  f*ck it I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket Then go get a jar from Branson And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson Load the three power  hop in the Eddie Bauer And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour Get a fresh baldy  make a few calls Shop at the mall  shoot a lil' ball Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time Spread it out on different floors And I'm gon' play lotto  for what? Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow  so what  You know when I was close to the ledge I'd probably be in the wedge With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds Thought of momma  wrote her a note  we ain't close I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat F*ck around and sniff an ounce of raw  bust the four Fours  pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor Jump in the whip  git them cats I wanted to git Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six Went home took a shower in nice cold water And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter  If you had twenty four hours to live just think Where would you go? What would you do? Who would you screw? And who would you wanna notify? Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?  If you had twenty four hours to live just think Where would you go?

What hey yo  if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw Run all them papi's spot  put one in his head at the door For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve The other eight had to be baking soda by itself So papi f*ck you  you dead now  I'm off to the bank With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face F*ck her in the safe  and have her take me to my place We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad For my son to have the same shit his pops just had And when I'm down to twenty three  I'm a be strapped wit TNT Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me  If I had twenty four hours to live  I'd probably die on the fifth Run in the station squeezin the inf' I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin' I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms When they come in with the bullets  you prepared with the bomb So f*ck bein' violent get stocks and bonds  Twenty four left until my death So I'm gon' waste alot of lives  but I'll cherish every breath I know exactly where I'm goin'  but I'mma send you there first And with the shit that I'll be doin'  I'mma send you there worse I've been livin' with a curse  and now it's all about to end But before I go  say hello to my little friend But I gots to make it right  reconcile with my mother Try to explain to my son  tell my girl I love her C-4 up under the coat  snatch up my dog Turn like three buildings on Wall Street  into a fog Out with a bang  you will remember my name I wanted to live forever  but this wasn't fame  If you had twenty four hours to live just think Where would you go?

1155,"It was a hot summer day  I was dyin from the heat
Walkin up 118th street
Although I'm hot like stew
In the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew
Now a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst
Or get some boom from the dread  which ever one comes first
Now is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)
So I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)
Now about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew
I looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2
I saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue
And one of them said: all I think about is havin you
Now in my mind I realized I coulda took her  coulda took her
But Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker
Don't mean to diss  but it's not on my list
So I gave her a kiss and said: ehm  good-bye  miss
From the streets I heard a horn beep
There was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep
I heard em speak  he said: my ride is fat
So why you're sweatin D-Nice  baby  he ain't all that
Now first things first  why all the rude behaviour
You shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor
He jumped out the jeep like yo  what up chief
But I don't eat pork  so I guess he wanted beef
I realized I was on my own
I didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown
He swung but missed  I caught him with a fist
Although I wish it didn't have to come to this
I started breakin him down with the speed  had him astounded
The right caught his jaw and it sounded
Like boom boom bap boom bam
He had no idea that D was nice with his hands
He stepped back  so I thought he was through
But right about now up steps his crew
We all threw down and went round for round
I'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down

They proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness
Somehow someway I was damn sure glad this
Person slid me a pistol from behind
Not the weasel  pop-pop-pop goes the 9
So if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them
I (murder them murder them)
But since I pulled the trigger I guess I have to pay the price

1156,"I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East coast  starin out to Africa
Accolades  Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's  wrap 'em up  mad as f*ck  need a ladder up
Escalator  elevator  skyscraper  hella haters
On Primo beats  meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts  hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap  true dat  who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight ' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry  and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy  future of the rap
Golden Era dead {""No time for looking back  it's done""}

We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?

Before I fade to black  face the mirror  face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow  fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me  calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect  I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up  'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper  take his mic  greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price  A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem  we a tight  chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this

We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?
We in the 25th hour  it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever  remember
In the end time waits for no man  what's your plan?

You ever chant with the rebels  dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels  ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go  stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified  exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all  achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out  they 'bout beat  by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young  hell or heaven
Them adolescents  is pedalin  packin metal and settlin
Street wars  revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls  psychos strike the right chords
They at pause  bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack  they lost
Wipe a lot  no time for looking back  it's done

1167,"I stay up all night  I go to sleep watching Dragnet
Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet
I'm so rope  they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise  you know I'm the cool coper
On the mic I score  just like the Yankees
Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spanky
Excuse me young lady I don't mean to trouble ya
Ya lookin' so hot inside your BMW
I got lucky  I brought home the kitten
Before I got busy I slipped on the mitten
Can't get better odds because I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary is a turning and rolling like a ring-ding
Jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
I did the doo-wah diddy and bust 'em with the pre-roll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Don't rat out your boy over some rat weed
I'm out of your back door  I'm into another
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
Not perfect grammar  always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds

Roses are red  the sky is blue
I got my barrel at 'cha neck so what the f*ck you gonna do
It's just two wheels and me  the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
'Cause you know Y-A-U-C-H
I'm taking all MC's out in the place
Taking life as it comes  no fool am I
Going off  getting paid  and I don't ask why
Playin' beats on my box  making music for the many
Know a lot of def girls that are doing their thing
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I'm just chillin'  like Bob Dylan
Yeah I smoke cheeba  it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
People come up to me and they try to talk shit  man
I was making records when you were sucking your mother's dick


Girl  you're walking tall now in your fancy clothes
You got fancy things that goin' up your nose
You're getting fancy gifts from expensive men
You're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection  getting girls' affection
If your life needs correction  don't follow my direction
You got your 8x10  your agent  your Harley
You'll be driving around Hollywood  yo  sorry Charlie
'Cause I'm running things like some mack motherf*cker
You'll be slipping your slack in your face
'Cause your a false fake sucker
You slipped your slack  you cock me and you're wack
While I'm reading ""On The Road"" by my man Jack Kerouac
Poetry in motion  coconut lotion
Had to diss the girl because she got to emotional
Are you experienced little girl?
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
'Cause I'm on your mind  it's hard to forget me
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out  y'all PCP  song out
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
And I'm out",3-Minute Rule,1989,Hip Hop

Well you're lookin' at him now  cause the man is me And if you don't believe all the things I say I'm certified 'prime' by the USDA  Now the name that I use is DJ Run And I'm a fast-talkin' slow-walkin' number one And if you don't believe all the words I say Then you're a natural born fool who's got to be that way  I got a fifty rating and a fifty share Every minute  every hour that I'm on the air And when I come to town  I'm on a big marquee It says (DJ Run) and me  D.M.C.  And if you find that you don't like my ways Well  you can send me back in thirty days  A good job and lots of money might not be enough And to satisfy your needs it may be rough But I take some care and treat you nice And if it ain't sufficient once  I cold work it out twice  And if you find that you don't like my ways Well  you can send me back in 30 days  I'm gonna give you everything that you ever need If you need a pint of blood  then I'll even bleed If you're lookin' for a car  I will buy you two And if you're lookin' for a pet  I'll buy a kangaroo  If you need a vacation  we can fly the world And you'll know I'll never look at another girl I'm a single-minded man  and my mind is set You're the lady of the '80s that I'm gonna get  And if you find you don't like my ways Well  you can send me back in thirty days,30 Days,1984,Hip Hop

I know everything you wan do
I did all that by the age of twenty-one
By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch  I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar  I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you like f*ck this is child abuse
Call diapers  I might just be gettin' nicer
Them young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new twenty  nigga

I used to let my pants sag  not givin' a f*ck
Bad boy  now I'm all grown up

Bad boy  now I'm all grown up
I use to play the block like that (like that)
I use to carry knots like that (like that)
Now I got black cards  good credit and such

I got the fully in the tux
That was my past  now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun army  got a slum army
To hire a gun army  get you spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly
Listen to R and B when we get the call he's
No longer wit' us  fire your babysitters
You lil' f*cks fall back for real

1190,"What up on my Harlem niggas
My BK niggas
Back uptown baby
Lennox Ave.
My Oyas on Broadway all day

Aye yo you love the way I rep black
Step the f back
'Fore I bring out the guns
And chest check
Respect that
Any girl I met that 
Hit that
Love the way I spit that
I don't kit kat
Push your wig back
Get you shit snatched
Get your ribs cracked
Got a friend
Have me kick that
Get that 
Sit back
School shit skip that
Learn how to flip pack
For the big stacks
And the big act
Now I got the big gats
Click  clack  uhh
Since day one been in a ditch
Came with a snitch
Now I'm in the pen in the mix
Friends sending me flicks
Girls sending me kicks
Been in some shit
Had to tap a chin with a fist
When the ?
Begin with a stich
End in a kiss
So yo so I blend in the mix
Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
8½ on the dope ask Dominican Rich
Winning and rich
Eating on cinnamon grits
Grinning and shit
How a nigga spin in 6
See they all see the 12
But you see me in it
TVs in it
BBs kinted
Ask who it is
You see me tinted
I did drive-bys
Now I take you on top of a high rise
See if you can sky dive
I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
How 'bout the Palladium
F*ck it Yankees Stadium uhh
Play people  jumped up and sprayed people
I got dudes that'll jigg you with a AIDS needle
You not a threat
You want it you got it bet
I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet
Nigga wait now I'm set
I'll go another route
Kidnap your family make you brother eat your mother out
After I done dug her out
Needles to drug her out
Pillows to smother out
You don't give a f*ck about  I'm what a thug about
I'm through wit' it
Your crew ain't even true wit' it
I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
I know you pack like that
But Cam why you act like that
SHUT UP nigga clack clack clack
Pat pat pat
Rat tat tat
Put fear 'fore envy
Nigga I'm not in fear of any
I'll leave a nigga black and blue
Like a pair of Pennys
While me and Betha
Throw fiestas 
By alma queta
Chicqueta
Monero
Nieta
Don't ever f*ck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the Jon Cletta
Or the black boots
Jumpin out to act cool
Cars never lease 'em
Girls ? 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants got a crease in 'em
All calls valid
Never hard mallet
Dallas 
Been up in you favorite star's stlyus
Coward
Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
But you should thank Un though
Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door
Gun hold for fun though

Guy- Yo  yo  yo  yo (Cam- What's up?) what the f*ck is wrong with you
Cam- F*ck that it's not a game
Guy- Yo  you ain't gotta be rythmin for niggas like that
Cam- Man f*ck them niggas be	
Guy- Yo  you know what you do
Cam- What?
Guy- Tell these niggas the real deal
Cam- Aight check it

Aiyyo I'm ?  cook up the crack
Everytime you look up a gat
Got you shook up attack huh
Look in the back  nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up in check
On this work of the rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the f*ck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns  you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner and you're a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain dead
Light this herb 
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnapings and hostages
So  y'all better obey
We shoot pro way 
Mess with us no way

[Movie Quotes Intro]
Well this is the effect  all these films beginning ???
The kids are very impressionable.  Three?
They see all these films and they want to imitate their heroes.
What heroes though?
All they see is robbers  rapists  muggers  and murderers.
I'm impressed  you're a killer.

[Mr. Lif]
Yo
The plans' covered in asphalt
The Lord told me that its man's fault 
For perpetuating detrimental ways of living we can't halt
Everything inside ya move
You're caught inside a homicidal groove
Where only the idle loose
By violating one of life's most vital rules
Thou shalt not
But hell is a foul spot  where many are misinformed when they are taught
And thus cherish the untrue
Then die for the lies that they clung to
Del and I were there when they hung you
And as you swung to and fro 
We asked  (where did the humane humans go?)
With none in sight
We're left to focus on the same stunning fight
That spites the same force that put the sun in flight
So I summon night
The lack of light left some in fright
And living in fear
With something they couldn't bear
I promise to tell the truth and the whole truth
I solemnly swear

[Chorus 3x]
Left
Right
Up
Down
Diagonal
Three-hundred and sixty degrees

[Dj Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Progression  the lesson
I figure out which direction  then jettison
Minimalize perplexion
Flesh and bone  that's just a physical
I got a spiritual
Awareness  I have risen to
Its not mystical  something that I listen to
When these plastic motherf*ckers try to get in-to
My cypher  I ciphen they blood like they split in two
Yeah  Del  repel  arduous
The purest  give 'em service
With no insurance
Evil
I see through  like cellophane
Knowledge of self  that's why people see Del is strange
They want to humanize the most demonic dudes
Apply harmonic rules
Decide  who is the guy
Americas'
Just like a pair of glove
Don't want to share with us
Anarchy  tear it up

[Chorus 3x]
[Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Mr. Lif then Del alternating stanzas]
The new era  brings terror
You wish the quality of life was better
Peep the dilemma

Yeah life's getting dimmer
Stomachs' gettin' thinner
But your souls keep you full  obesity is for sinners

The sentiment lingers
Low self-esteem hinders

I tell my people 'bout slavery  no one remembers

Maybe they ought to take a look in they mirrors

Like Michael Jackson  and they actions gettin' clearer

Beware  the imagery might scare ya

If you ain't close to the source  then you don't like prosperity

One or many waitin' in line for therapy

But everyone bear a seed
Pure as the air we breathe

Look  I apologize  often womanize Took for my child to be born See through a woman's eyes Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles Took me too long for this song I don't deserve you  I harass you out in Paris Please come back to Rome  you make it home We talked for hours when you were on tour Please pick up the phone  pick up the phone Said: ""Don't embarrass me "" instead of ""Be mine"" That was my proposal for us to go steady That was your 21st birthday  you mature faster than me I wasn't ready  so I apologize I've seen the innocence leave your eyes I still mourn this death  I apologize for all the stillborns 'Cause I wasn't present  your body wouldn't accept it I apologize to all the woman whom I Toyed with you emotions because I was emotionless I apologize 'cause at your best you are love And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed And you stare blankly into space Thinkin' of all the time you wasted it  on all this basic shit So I apologize  I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should  I apologize  our love was one for the ages and I contained us And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive now Meant to cry and die alone in these mansions Or sleep with our back turned We're supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn We're supposed to laugh 'til our hearts stop And then we end a space with a dark stop And let love light the way Like the men before me  I cut off my nose to spite my face I never wanted another woman to know Something about me that you didn't know I promised  I cried  I couldn't hold I suck at love  I think I need a do-over I will be emotionally available if I invited you over I stew over what if you over my shit?  I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should  And if my children knew  I don't even know what I would do If they ain't look at me the same I would prob'ly die with all the shame ""You did what with who?"" What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? ""You risked that for Blue?"" If I wasn't a superhero in your face My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake And you go online and see For Blue's tooth  the tooth fairy didn't pay  I'm never gonna treat you like I should",4:44,2017,Hip Hop

You said you're goin' to bed soon

And I pretended I was sleeping (uh) and I was hoping

It's 5 o'clock in the morning  and I want ya
And you want me  don't ya?

Cause you've been waiting on me since I said that I was hittin' the club

Something coming up on me

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)

And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (oh)

They like the hype and I like the mic
We both like to fight  them girls like to lips me

Don't take part if you don't like drama  that's risky

Verse One: Grymreaper

I floss my teeth on the gospel tracks
I'm not an apostle  but I bring the axe to ya back
I chew and attack
Like Crest on plaque
After that  your world is flack
You drop into a hole
Your mold separates from your soul
Behold  the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware'
But you didn't listen
So now we appear an' eardrums glisten  ha ha

Chorus

Verse Two: Gatekeeper

When I wreck I commence to ditect
Ready to disect so come step alive and die
Next murder is mayhem
Diggin graves is irregular
Treach-orous mangler
Tha Boston Strangler
Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
Daredevil  the rhyme rebel my heart terminates
Subduin and pul-ver-i-zin ya head
Ya bled  fell dead  and your tombstone red

Darkness shall fall upon y'all

Verse Four: Undertaker

In the mind I come with the sparks from the attic
Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
Twist lifting mist like riff of a Taurus
Deep in tha forest  I slay for tha porridge
Yet is gold  ya die slow like a tortoise
Deep in my chorus  ya result Diggamortis
Let me see I'm castin disease
Contrary  yet some fairy 'cause ya bleed

Verse Five: Rzarector

Demonic  ya sonic is bangin like chronic

I came on the scene
in a wheel that Ezekiel seen
to exploit your flaws like Philistines
Look in the sky  oh my  it is I
No alibi  so don't even try

I might as well give this up like heavy sales And just f*ck an leave D12 and this blunt We can't self destruct I've never felt it this much Come on fellas  get up We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life  I walk with a limp  pistol hanging off-a the hip I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick We can't take you serious  you a comedy skit You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's But the only thing you shoot is the breeze I can't believe you speaking on moving key's But every time we hear you kick it The only thing you selling is wolf tickets I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack So when they bust you better bust back And get your guts clapped outa your stomach And when they want it (yeah) I bring a hundred niggas from runave So get your gun and if you coming  [Chorus]",6 in the Morning,2004,Hip Hop
1278,"Niemals wird es wieder so werden wie es war und deshalb nehm' ich meinen Stift und markier' mir dieses Jahr in meinem Tagebuch mit einem schwarzen Rand. Alles begann damit  dass Take That aus den Bravo-Charts verschwand. Einfach abgelöst von einem Dancefloor-Act. Ich wurde damals Zeuge wie so manche Fans vor Schreck i Ihren Piercing-Ring verschluckten und den Teddy fallen ließen denn Howard und Jason und wie sie alle hießen die gehörten ganz nach vorne und nicht in den Hintergrund. Meine Schwester wählte sich für den TED die Finger wund denn für ihre Stars hätte sie alles unternommen. Doch damit nicht genug  es sollte noch viel dicker kommen. Take That war ihr einziges Hobby. Es war schon verdammt schwer für sie als sich Robbie vom Rest der Band trennte - das war nicht ihr Glückstag Doch dass sie sich dann ganz auflösten brach ihr das Rückgrat.  Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen. Weißt du nicht  dass sowas Scheiße ist?  Es ist schon wirklich seltsam  wie die Dinge gehen. Ich schaue mir die Welt an  kann sie manchmal einfach nicht verstehen. Ich weiß  das Leben ist nicht immer fair   Doch die Erde dreht sich weiter  als ob nichts gewesen wär'.  Wir wussten damals nicht  wir krank sie war versuchten es mit BSB  dem Methadon für Junkies dieser Art  kauften alle Poster  Weihnachts- und Osterausgaben von Bravo-Girl und Mädchen  wollten bloß darauf warten dass sie die Jungs vergaß  doch sie aß kaum einen Bissen  wollte nichts von Backstreet Boys und Bed'n'Breakfast wissen und so blieb das Kopfkissen in ihrem Bettchen nass und eines Tages kam der letzte Auftritt bei Wetten dass? Unvorstellbar  diese Massenhysterie. Ich verstehe nicht  wieso sich die Verfassungsschützer nie mit Take That beschäftigt haben  denn sowas gab's nicht einmal bei Scientology oder den Zeugen Jehovas. Und Thomas Gottschalks Spott half auch nicht um die Fans zu beruhigen  es war einfach unglaublich: weibliche Tränen  unbeschreibliche Szenen und meine Schwester beschloss  das Zeitliche zu segnen.  Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen. Weißt du nicht  dass sowas Scheiße ist?  Es ist schon wirklich seltsam  wie die Dinge gehen. Ich schaue mir die Welt an  kann sie manchmal einfach nicht verstehen. Ich weiß  das Leben ist nicht immer fair  doch die Erde dreht sich weiter  als ob nichts gewesen wär'.  Dann nach dem letzten Lied kam's zur Eskalation. Es war während der Werbung  als der Rest der Nation sich 'n neues Bier aufmachte dachte keiner daran  daß meine Schwester grad eben aus dem Fenster sprang. Wir fanden sie im Garten  neben dem Hibiskus. Ein weiteres Opfer von Boygroup-Fanatismus. Wann ist Schluß mit dieser Scheiße   Wie viele Teenies müssen noch ins Gras beißen!? Der CD-Player lief noch  ich hörte es deutlich ""How deep is your love"" es waren sechs Meter neunzig.  Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen. Weißt du nicht  dass sowas Scheiße ist?",6 Meter 90,1997,Hip Hop

With this specified time you can do as you please
Make a decision to create life or spread death and disease

We got 360 degrees of emcees
That make these rap niggaz sound like they swangin' from trees
Everythang from brain food to puttin' broads on they knees
We do it all for the love and never all for the cheese

Hot tub  bubbling like warm water call me  hot tub
Cut your wife and daughter like a meat cleaver  we be the Dungeon Family
Niggaz up under the step from A T L to over stand me
D F  is the clique I represent  puffin' purple
Poppin' poppers  spittin' straight pimp shit

Conversation without compensation  we sensed it
It's not to mention yo' girl  your persistant in
Nothin' physical happened but give me 6 minutes
When ya off  somebody gonna fit in it

Say no names  wear my hair longer than your first strang
Yo' girl wish she was drafted for the Georgia drill team
But I ain't gon' say no more
You need to catch somebody else I'm 'bout to hit the door  I'ma

Fine lil' mama  my home gon' be a palace
Laid out like a salad  keep a nigga from malace
I'm movin' things to the south
A dog like me need a pussycat 'round the house  with a row bone

Ain't nothin' like me  you baby with no clothes on
I'm tired of runnin' the streets all night
And a girlfriend ain't gon' stay down witcha like a wife
I can't let all you girls get to my head
'Cuz you know what I want between them legs

Hey I'm just walkin' outta foot locker strollin' through green briar
Stepped in the food court just gonna but a bean pot
Ay cool cool cutta  cut her to the finch
If a girl gotta future behind her  I'm up in it

And I like a pretty lady with a tailback mouth
'Cuz if you hit the right spot  she'll go back runnin' her mouth
Now every time I meet a girl she puttin' her hand in her purse
And when my next record drop I ain't wearin' no shirt let's do it

Hats off  nigga can we put a fist in 'fore we handle business?
Hallelujah  for the bank
Benzes  houses  hummers  tanks and all that
Gon' see  that they meet shack in the end

The world was my enemy  that's who was my friends
On the strong delucious  unstoppable  followin' the tradition of men
Can't say aww look at that man
He's too dirty for industry dead ass  or is he!

Five minutes and fiftynine seconds gone by
Are you really ready for this lyrical high?
We can shoot without bullets  D F to the fullest
Should it  ever come to light it's true art  not hype

Comin' strong  take the mic  make sure it's tight

Ten dimes do too and I ain't take none shorter

Pay attention to every quote we say
'Cuz I got this here like it's in stores today
Holla ready to rock  when he step on the scene
'Cuz shorty stay clean like  shicka-ding shicka-ding

Well I can be that and you need that  freaky D that
And if you want your monologue and open come and seek me
A few done fried man or we can bligh man
I'm the guy that kill ya cat and  I dare you to defy me

If you can time me  I promise in sixty seconds
You'll be intriged and overwhelmed and obligated to rewind me
That reminds me and my name is the Divinely

You woulda been made your way over here to the V.I.P. with us

Where yo' man at? What's the matter with that clown
Leavin' a sharp-ass lil' broad like you up in here with all us players?
Hopefully you up in here with some of yo' friends  so some of my friends
Can get with some of yo' friends and turn it into somethin'

To mix me one of my customized drinks without the blender
Get everybody up in the club up in here off the numb-numb juice
Vodka  7-Up  and Cran-apple juice

The ladies outnumber the fellas six-to-one

Leave skid marks all on the gravel
Drivin' like a bat outta hell to the hotel
Bounce roll rock skate side to side

Now when you see me in the Lamborghini speeding  bumpin Screw
I know you see my license plate  ""Lil' Flip number two""
I use to skip summer school  hit the block and move work
That was enough to buy some shoes  pants  and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff  wearin diamonds like Puff
We got everybody else music sounding like US
So hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been bumpin Screw down here for a while!
And when you see me at the mall  Just me and my dawg
I'm shoppin with them  Cause I ain't trickin for a broad
I do shows and rock crowds  And then I get paid
Summer time  I'm on dubs  Winter time  I'm on blades
My whole click livin laid  man we all got Vets
My crib so big  I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe  Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL  standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice  so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap  so I pimp these streets
You don't work you don't eat  that's a known fact
I just don't rap  nigga I know how to act
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been f*ckin with magazines for a while!

Now when you see me with Tigga  On BET
Or 106 and Park  with AJ and Free
Or MTV  come take a look at my house
And after that  come take a look at my mouth
Yea I represent the South  like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean  like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been talkin shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet  blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10  I'm probably blowin Hydro
So don't blow my high  just leave me alone!
Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tatoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been smokin high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club  I gotta get my floss on
Techno  my ring shinnin  and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone  Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call  you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper  but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider  and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been acting bad  drivin cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin  like UGK
I'm choppin on blades  candy-paint  Jog Grey
I'm sittin on Twenty's  but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin with an AK  you still got a be	-be	 Gun
So you need to Back  Back  and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been ridin around with straps for a while!

1293,Sometimes I just feel like Quitting I still might Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write? Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics And show these people what my level of skill's like But I'm still white Sometimes I just hate life Something ain't right Hit the brake lights Case of the stage fright Drawing a blank like  Dah  dah  dah. dah It ain't my fault Great then I fall My insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just can't do it My whole manhood's just been stripped I have just been ripped So I must then get Off the bus then split Man f*ck this shit Yo  I'm going the f*ck home World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road  I'm a man I'm a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks  man I'ma never look back And I'm gone I know right where I'm going Sorry  momma  I'm grown I must travel alone Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road  Walking these train tracks Tryin' to regain back The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap To the same plant And the same pants Tryin' to chase rap Gotta move ASAP Get a new plan Momma's got a new man Poor little baby sister  she don't understand Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand While she colors her big brother  her mother and dad Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad Sometimes I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet Don't got a rep  my step Don't got enough pep The pressure's too much  man I'm just tryin' to do what's best And I try Sit alone and I cry Yo I won't tell no lie Not a moment goes by That I don't pray to the sky Please  I'm beggin' you God Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are Yo  I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow Tell my mother I love her  kiss baby sister goodbye Say whenever you need me  baby  I'm never too far But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow On everything I own I'll make it on my own Off to work I go Back to this 8 Mile Road  I'm a man Gotta make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks  man I'ma never look back And I'm gone I know right where I'm going Sorry  momma  I'm grown I must travel alone Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road  You gotta live it to feel it You didn't  you wouldn't get it Or see what the big deal is Why it was and it still is To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits It's different and it's a certain significance A certificate of authenticity You'd never even see But it's everything to me It's my credibility You'd never seen  heard  smelled or met a real mc Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me But yet still unsigned Having a rough time Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line When it comes crunch time Where did my punch lines go? Who must I show? To bust my flow Where must I go? Who must I know? Or am I just another crab in the bucket Cause I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but f*ck it Maybe I need a new outlet I'm starting to doubt shit I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with I live like a bum  yo my clothes ain't about shit At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit And it's cold Trying to travel this road Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode My defenses are so up The one thing I don't want Is pity from no one This city is no fun There is no sun And it's so dark Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart From each one of my limbs By each one of my friends It's enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin Sometimes I feel like a robot Sometimes I just know not What I'm doing  I just blow  my head is a stove top I just explode  the kettle gets so hot Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got But I've learned It's time for me to u-turn Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl I can not only play stupid or be immature I got every ingredient all I need is the courage Like I already got the beat all I need is the words Got the urge Suddenly it's a surge Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third I am no longer scared now  I'm free as a bird Then I turn and cross over the median curb Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur I'm Eight Mile Road  I'm a man Gotta make a new plan Time for me to just stand up and travel new land Time for me to just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks  man I'ma never look back And I'm gone I know right where I'm going Sorry  momma  I'm grown I must travel alone Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road,8 Mile,2002,Hip Hop

(intro)   There are 8 million stories in the naked city     8 million stories (x4)     (verse one Kurtis blow)     There are 8 million stories in the naked city   Some ice cold and told without pity   About the mean streets and the guetto culture   The pimps the pushers the sharks and vultures   Things that happen when it reaches dark   And all the things you hear about Central Park   You got to be down you got to have strength   If you're gonna survive past 110th   Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled   The emergency ward is capacity filled   And nothin' ever comes as a big surprise   And the naked city never closes its eyes   A new story every day   Told a thousand different ways   That's how it is and that's how it goes   The city with the 8 and six big O's     New York is a crazy city man.....     Yo  my home boys Run DMC     (verse two Run DMC)     A young girl seemed to be gaining weight   Her parents all thought it was the food she ate   Their attitudes were all la-de-da-de   But little did they know there's a baby in the body   She tried to hide it but they'll soon know   Because sooner or later that baby's got to show   Can her daddy just accept it as a fact   That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack   Then there's another girl her name is Vicki   The girl is fine but sho'nuff tricky   Vicki's fine  but then she's not very kind   She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind   You wake up in the morning and you're feelin' blue   Because Vicki is gone and your money is too   She's more sinister than Peter Lorre   And this is just two of 8 million stories     8 million stories (x12)     (verse three Kurtis Blow)     Fresh kid and the stories complete   Born on a dim lit ghetto street   Father unknown mother astray   He learned about life the real hard way   Wearin' pretty things for all the ladies to see   Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry   Spent all his time just counting his bank   Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha now fill in the blank   Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long   Been the subject of a ghetto song   Poor kids admire ladies desire   They say water can't put out this fire   Because he's a fresh kid yeah he's alright   Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night   And you could measure or even treasure   The thought that cocaine became his pleasure   Puruvian rock never cut with speed   And he gets skied until his nose would bleed   And that was just one weakness must admit   That when he took a hit he could never quit   Because he's one slick pusher livin' day by day   When the crazy thing happened along the way   You know he started to base at a hell a pace   And now it's a disgrace he's got the pipe in his face   For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones   Didn't take care of business didn't answer the phone   He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone   Just bittin' on a pipe like a dog on a bone   Turnin' blue in the face by holdin' his breath   With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest   But then he tried to stop but it never worked   And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk   Just to break it all down you know he's not very slick   Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick   He lost his car his house his friends and his wife   And basing cocaine made him lose his wife   Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay   And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away   In a blaze of glory in his own territory   8 million stories sad but all real stories     8 million stories (x12),8 Million Stories,1984,Hip Hop

I was innocent then  I ain't do no wrong
She said  ""you mommy little man "" I said  ""yep  uh huh""
She was everything to me  when she came  I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp  all did up
It was welfare hustlin'  they killed her for that
The first shot  bullet wound in my back
I'm f*cked up  look at my sneakers  I'm f*cked up
Now I'm on my own  mommy gone
Sam said  ""you a young boy  why your clothes look so old?
You don't need fish  little nigga  you need a pole
You don't need no new kicks  you need an O""
Chop that  bag it  get right back at it
That touched me  it hit me in my heart
I'm a hustler  homie  you was giving me my start
I am what I am  Sabrina's only baby
Practicing in the mirror  pulling out my .380
Oh man  I f*cked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will  see
Seven grams of cocaine  three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look  I'm outta control  my gun go
Off like it's legal  call the cops  you need to
Give 'em my description  I ain't bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn't last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left  in case niggas try to get me
That's nine shots  we just call it fifty

I wake up late every morning
Managers calling  I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and makeup's
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on I was drunk last night
Now its all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phones on silent I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I ain't no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
And deres no turning back I'm working a 9 to 5

So you gotta do somthin' for channel you
Channel who sorry who I'm half way through a snooze
Oh! Channel you the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Prices boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my red bull and my sandwich  I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum  action
No I'd actually id rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Lets not wake her up she actually looks quite sweet

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back cause I'm working a 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy thats all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
I ain't no early birdy
Won't wake up till 12:30
Would it be bothered to say much ere
So oh dear
Huh where am I man?
This? ain't good? what's going on?!

So my label would change my image
I'm a pink lipstick chick called dipstick
This ain't on my wish list
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting see-beebies
Have you seen me?
Never again  am I drinking lambrini
Its alright Sov it's a dream just wake up?

Oh my Gosh my days are getting longer
And there's no turning back 'cause I'm working the 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy I'll say it again

I took my mind on this road  way through
I take your mind on this road  you do
I took my mind on this road  way through

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me
These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways  where I'm supposed to go
Ah  shit  get out my pocket

The stench from the smoke could smell so ferocious
Winos in the alley  nearly slumped over
Demons in they eyes  glassy  no Folgers
Wake up sober  kill you for a cold one
Snotty nosed rascals  big ratchet toters
Give it up slowly  click  clack  it's over
Something like Velcro  stay attached to corners
Hood rats plotting  riding for the blue cheese
All for the Gram  grams and a new weave
All they gotta spend expands  and some loose knees
Niggas taking chances  tip-toeing with two P's
No one's a simp  weak or strong they do bleed
Candle light vigils  closure if they do leave
Bullets have a name defined by different calibers
Concrete jungle  beware of different challengers
Gotta have the stomach for dookie bags and catheters
Play your cards right or be scratching off them calendars

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me
These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways  where I'm supposed to go
Ah  shit  get out my block

These waters are murky  crocodiles they lurking
Murder rate merging  up and down virgins
Guess you gotta play street versions of a surgeon
Keep beat bursting  closing down all your curtains
When shit don't go right  gotta question your purpose
Denim with them serpents coming back to surface
EBT  zero balance  worthless
You either leave in limousines or them hearses
Too much bad blood  another problem emerges
You started the problem you motherf*cking deserved it
Politicking  a lot of liquor  that be the answer
They Marlboro  trying to trick them  they be the cancer
Gotta get that loose change  you gotta kick a nigga brain
Like your name Liu Kang  that be the mantra
Stop  look  listen  that's the words to live by
Know you gotta stake your claim  like a rib-eye
90059  nigga  here's why

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me
These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways  where I'm supposed to go
Ah  shit  get out my pocket

A force from the rap game my nigga  this ain't a circus
There's no Ringling Brothers  no Barnum and Bailey
Clowned ass niggas get marked out daily  trucked out lately
Bitch niggas get they hat brought to them  you don't communicate
Well hands and the gat talk to you  what's the convo?
Don't think fast  you end up getting a combo
Think situations is calm  then they bomb though
Sleeping in the bando  it's either death or jail
Something you never planned for  dreaming about Lambos
Wake up shivering  pillow next to a lamppost
Straight up out the motherf*ckin' crockpot it's Watts
One stops leave you with dope  socks is not boxed
No rats  re-rock that got them all losing weight
Got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot
Gotta call up Dr. Dre just for the Detox
All of this in one zip code  keep the streets hot

I don't know why niggas keep f*cking with me

I'm chillin with my man Phesto  my man A-Plus
And my man Op'  you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland  California and  um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now  yo  we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits  call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends  yo  I can dig it
Here's a forty  swig it  y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler  break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females  so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you  if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one  I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight  so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut  the cinema  was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range  I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat  I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah  this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh  this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill  from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Huh  my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business  I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo  crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops  wanna stop - our fun  but the top
Is where we're dwellin  swell and fat  no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses  this bro's quick
Yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close  kid

I'm posted  most kids accept this as cool
I exit  cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
Or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement  my ace been
Fattenin up tracks  Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

Greenbacks in stacks  don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts  cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit

I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt  folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber  zestin
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

Restin at the mall  attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
Some cute fits  some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this  peepin what my crew gets (huh)
Loot  props  respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit  but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope  why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba  I'mma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

I'm chillin with my man Phesto  my man A-Plus
And my man Op'  you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland  California and  um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now  yo  we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits  call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends  yo  I can dig it
Here's a forty  swig it  y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler  break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females  so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you  if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one  I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight  so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut  the cinema  was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range  I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat  I be the chill from 93 'til

Huh  my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business  I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo  crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops  wanna stop - our fun  but the top

1320,"Yeah  last year a lot of motherf*ckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherf*ckin nigga)
Yeah  we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem  Marq
(Huh  tell them man  tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it

I got a ho from the East  got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North  a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair  a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife  a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey  the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not  she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister  though
Ice in the whole damn herd
I f*ck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink  who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to f*ck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits  a bitch with ass
A bitch with none  but hey I give her a pass
And I love 'em all  I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems  I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it..
Nah a bitch ain't one

I got a bitch that's old  a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat  a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny  a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing  a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves f*ckin on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano  a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked  a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short  a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all  I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems  I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show
These motherf*ckers all the over the world; the 2 Live style
Of how the bitches treat a motherf*ckin fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes  cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation  dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em  I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter  the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my bitches  cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em  f*ck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham  bam  thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So f*ck how you feel  you f*ckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one!

Ha! Yo Marquis my motherf*cker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll f*ck you right after she f*cks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast  a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man BECAUSE THEY'RE ""Bitches 2""
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap  a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs  I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells  I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty  got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all  I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems  I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me
No a bitch ain't one
(Huh  you know a bitch ain't one!)

1331,"Chorus
I'm from the ninth ward[Been there since the day I was born]
From the ninth ward[Got us coming up like a storm]
From the ninth ward[Niggas better sound the alarm]
Here come the ninth ward ninth ward hard

[Magic]
Bitch I was born and raised in the ninth ward
So you niggas don't bother me
You can say what you may about the ninth ward
But I bet you won't follow me
'Cross that canal where my niggas dwell
You know me well
Cause I sold rocks  upon my block
Till I was hotter than hell
Every nigga down here remember me
Nothin' really changed but my gold teeth
I'm still that same nigga from my Flood Street
Only difference now is that I'm on my feet
And I don't sell dope no mo'
Don't rob no mo'
Mane a nigga don't plot no mo'
Cause I'm performing in shows 
Shakin' off hoes
Smokin' on optimos
It'll be a World War 3 f*ck with me
Now my niggas won't let that ride
I'm the only nigga out chere screaming 9th Ward
So people tryin' to keep me alive
Everywhere I go they see the nine on my arm
And they swear that I'm in a gang
But nigga this is a warning  I'm 'bout my hands
Like I'm 'bout them motherf*cking thangs
I'm trouble starter just like my father 
He was raised in the nine
So if you cut my arm it still tated in my mind
No matter millions or which ever the situation might come
I'll never forget you niggas 
Never forget where the f*ck I'm from

Chorus-2x

[Magic]
You know you could take the nigga out the nine
But you can't take the nine out of nigga
Pulling capers is my nature 
I'm addicted to making paper
Got my own way of living 
Bitch I'm from the see-T-see
Where niggas roam around looking for beef
Killing for free 
I take this ward shit to heart 
It's tated on my arm
So me and my niggas never part
I keep you niggas in my mind 
For every clucker that I serve
For every nigga that I shot
For every tourist that I robbed
To every god damn rock
For every cop that done chased me 
To the bitches that hate me
What have you done for me lately
For every neighbor that was peeking at four o'clock in da morn
It never helped to lock me up
You could've left me alone
We learned to improvise on my block
Never had a ball 
We played football wit' a concrete rock
Now picture that
I could never forget my mission
I'm a turn the nine into something bigger that yo' vision
Before I'm done the world'll scream

Chorus-2x",9th Ward,1998,Hip Hop
1332,"Ah yea
Whole world
M-C's
Whose slick?

We lounge stay phat notice our G limp
A natural flair with our fresh ass hair
Style baggy out clouts slick
Creamy and fresh east coast to west

Brooklyn
Uptown
To the universal fair
Old school M-C's

I'm slicker this year  I'm slicker this year
Myrtle Ave A train got the pic in my hair
And what 16 joints later still lounge
Fresh  from flat bush in my baggy booster gets

Style is tight ee's bust the cami' fatigues
50 000 leagues of black  so what's up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the east and wild Crooklyn  New york

Creamy kid yo Smith and Wesson win a blessing
The angular slang blow spots  bang  11
Hangin' like bats 'cause the 12 inch wax
Say scorpio and my hair say 'fro

And my blood say bro  my clics say  ""Eh  yo!""
Make sparks from the barrel me tal pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wild flowers

Scott La Rock had 'em all  I gots the ball
And roll a little panthers through these project halls
The 3 color flag can't hold my baggys sag
7 1 8 to omega

Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of the classic
Now glamour boys want to be triple phatted
But I'm slicker this year  I'm slicker this year  yea

East born Beast candles on
Lovely all over the city
And your tape deck blasting
7 hours and the phat fly sneakers and the camouflage

To the hip hop nation
To the mix tape crew
To the west coast
To the boogie down Bronx

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And 5 elements posture take a be boy stance
With the gold front shinin'  the baggy pants saggin'
This Brooklyn stylin' got the fly girls smilin'

But I'm climbin'  findin' new ways of rhymin'
Not livin' like a star is strickly about survivin'
Divin'  deep into the groove of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles

Yes  the notorious  with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes of conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional

Lyrical skills of the insect emotion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now I'm rolling with the 7 and the crescent
Puffin' some expression  manifestin' today's lesson

Stressin' the fact that I'm solar guaranteed to go far
'Cause the mind is inter stellar
Still pieced like that so have no fear
But I'm slicker this year  I'm slicker this year

To the queens everywhere
To the whole S I
To the lumpen mass
Don't forget about your peeps when ya

Now you see that I am 68 inches above sea level
93 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter  play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn  any order

You want 'em I got 'em drippin' like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing  moving within the truth circles
We played you made you change strictly ought to

We stratify our wealth from my looty in the bank
There's love amongst the ranks
Now I'm a 'bout to meet my home girl 'cause we be alike
A alike  see alike  let's G alike

1337,"Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest  Nobody understands what it takes to be the man Having every single person say you can't when you can To give up everything you've ever known for a dream And never stop the fight no matter how hard it seems You sacrifice  you bleed  you sweat  and you cry Doing everything you can not to lay down and die When you fall and you call out  there's no one to help So you've got no other option but to pick up yourself At the end of the battle you're the only one standing Everyone watching  the stage you're commanding The pages of history will speak of today And when they talk about the champion This is what they'll say  Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest  People will break you right down to nothing if you let 'em They'll say  ""There's a million others like you  what makes you better?"" But remember that these folks are afraid of the unknown They're the ones who wet the bed if they go 10 miles from home Stay Down: Is what they scream in your ear The only weapon that they have to use is fear So you take all the beatings and you take all the hits  But your back on your feet for more  you don't quit You'll never back down  never stop  never pause Never give up  never sacrifice the cause This is your life  you gonna let somebody take it? Look in the mirror That's all you need to make it Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest  The smoke has all cleared  and you own the throne You're king of the castle  and everybody knows They bow in your presence  and fear your might Cause they know for damn sure what it  what it  Here's what it looks like (Looks like)  Being the best What it looks like  to be a cut above the rest",A  Cut Above,2009,Hip Hop

Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true  the makings of you)

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby  caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy  you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy  you remind me  remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys  you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true  these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold  baby; you should know
Baby  you remind me of so much
And  baby  you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims  you shine

Boy  you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around  looking like a superstar
Boy  you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me  and you're my property

Looking at you  looking at another  baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure  baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist  it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips  armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys  you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip  you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine  and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

It's when I'm goin' right

Is just a little different from all the rest

Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me (a girl like me)

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Wanna take a chance
On something real

1349,"Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die But some cry  and gets by  while others choose to wonder why His life was took at such an early age A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gage  He used to hustle on the street corners His mom would always beg him to quit  but he didn't wanna As he got older  he got even worse 'Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse  A cold night in his hood  he had a tangle The brother he was squabblin' with  had broke his ankle Laid him out in the driveway Some people knew he wouldn't survive  but hey  I ain't the one to speak up on another's All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook  He had a baby that he couldn't raise And she will never see her father again  'cause he's in a grave I always think about [Incomprehensible] ""My daddy was a dopeman  so I'ma be a dope dealer""  How will the family explain it? ""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head"" He ain't around to see her walk Dry her eyes when she cries  pick her up when she falls  Just the thought of a kid livin' fly f*cks me up When his girl has to raise a bastard child It gets deeper  he used to punch her and beat her She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater  She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card Had a kid  now she's realizin' life is hard A big time dope dealer's all she wanted Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it  The situation's got me guessin' But the answer remains to be a question He lived his life in a lie I guess you only get a minute to pray  and a second to die  It was crazy how it happened Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin' All I could see was a pistol spittin' rounds And the boy was just screamin' as he fell to the ground  A woman yelled  ""Get an ambulance"" But I knew he was dead  he didn't stand a chance You shoulda seen him  he was scared A bullet goes to his chest  and one to his head  He just laid there in silence And all I heard was the siren Paramedics pulled up Followed by a law man and in came a firetruck  Put his ass on the stretcher But if he survives  I'm willin' to betcha He'll be out for revenge They patched him up within a week  he was back at it again  Went to his brother on the North side Grab your shit  it's a hit  we're gonna take a long ride Packed it up in the trunk AK-47  M-11 and a pump  Rolled by [Incomprehensible] on Scott Street School was lettin' out ""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?""  Watch me Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun  he shot him  Put his tooly on the front seat Continued his mission  as he headed down the street The kids was just starin' at each other J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother  Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port Full speed down Reed  shot his mom on the porch On his way down Collard His brother was just dazed in a shock  ""Why you do it?""  Why you shot his moms Jay?

1350,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell About this guy you all know him  he had me scared as hell! He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred! He wears the same hat and sweater every single day And even if it's hot  outside he wears it anyway! He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!  [Fresh Prince] It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right And we had just gotten back off tour last night So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies I got Angie  Jeff got Tina Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life That was all right because the lady was chill Then we dipped to the theater set to ill We saw Elm Street and man it was def And everything seemed all right when we left But when I got home and laid down to sleep That began the nightmare  but on my street!  [Fresh Prince] It was burnin in my room like an oven My bed soaked with sweat  and man  I was buggin I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30 It had melted it was so darn hot  and I was thirsty I went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke Flipped the TV off  and then I almost choked When I heard this awful voice comin from behind It said  "";You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!""; Man  I ain't even wait to see who it was Broke outside my drawers and screamed  "";So long  cuz!""; Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin Then thought  "";Oh  I get it  I must be dreamin""; I strolled back home with a grin on my grill I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill I walked in the house  the Big Bad Fresh Prince But Freddy killed all that noise real quick He grabbed me by my neck and said  "";Here's what we'll do. We gotta lotta work here  me and you. The souls of your friends you and I will claim. You've got the body  and I've got the brain.""; I said  "";Yo Fred  I think you've got me all wrong. I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long! Look  I'll be honest man  this team won't work. The girls won't be on you  Fred your face is all burnt!""; I patted him on the shoulder said  "";Thanks for stopping by.""; Then I opened up the door and said  "";Take care guy!""; He got mad  drew back his arm  and slashed my shirt I laughed at first  then thought  "";Hold up  that hurt!""; It wasn't a dream  man  this guy was for real I said  "";Freddy  uh  pal  there's been an awful mistake here.""; No further words and then I darted upstairs Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed Pulled the covers up over my head And said  "";Oh please do somethin with Fred!""; He jumped on my bed  went through the covers with his claws Tried to get me  but my alarm went off And then silence! It was a whole new day I thought  "";Huh  I wasn't scared of him anyway.""; Until I noticed those rips in my sheets And that was proof that there had been a nightmare  on my street  FP: Oh man  I gotta call Jeff  I gotta call Jeff Come on  come on Come on Jeff  answer  Come on  man JJ: Hello? FP: Jeff  this is Prince  man Jeff  wake up   Jeff  wake up JJ: What do you want? FP: Jeff  wake up  man   listen to me  Jeff JJ: It's three o'clock in the mornin  what do you want? FP: Jeff  Jeff  would you listen to me? Listen  whatever you do  don't fall asleep JJ: Man! FP: Jeff  listen to me  don't go to sleep  Jeff JJ: Look  look  I'll talk to you tomorrow  I'm going to bed {FC} RRAHHHH! JJ: Ahhhhhh!  FP: Jeff! Jeff! {FC} Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa! JJ: Ahhhhhh!

1352,"Stay out!  You couldn't see the clearing from the road So  alone I sit  my legs folded and eyes closed This is the place that I go To come to grips that my sanity's juxtaposed With insanity  overload And I'm afraid of my soul When I'm back here  I'm all alone There ain't no screaming for help When you're gone  they'll never know  All the way to the drowning Heavy stick in my hand and my heart  it keeps pounding I'm holding them under And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder See I hunt them like wild lions And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife Taxidermy like Mormons  stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs The thing that's important  is to never dispose of the edible organs Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs A place in the woods  where no one will hear you dying or seeing you live again Rest here  you're home now  I'll keep you here with all of them  Sometimes when you look in the woods  the woods... Look back ""I don't like to be-"" there's no one in the... I am the woods Do you believe in the devil? I- I shouldn't of gone in there Stop going there  -do you go in there for?

Off in the shadows on darkest of nights There stands the heartless  his targets in sight Underbrush overgrown  death stays hidden Moss growth camouflage  body parts missin' Trophy collection connected to the prize Like to hear em scream  always look em in the eyes Where my disguise is the face of a victim Get excited everytime I knife sticks em Watch em die in a place in the woods  the sensation feel so good Drag em to the cabin  singing and laughing Addicted to the feelin'  so appealin' is the killin'  Sometimes when you look in the woods  the woods...

1370,"Wake up

Wake up  get a hold of your life  go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat  or you get ate up
Straight up  you tired of waiting  go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us  I  I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put  put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But  but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color  creed  or your religion
Priests  politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position  we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position  we still ain't got a pot to piss in

Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still  knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Ow  trying religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery  there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
To steal your face  [?]
I'm G-O-D  to infinity  for real

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah  just you and me

Poor reparations  the Bush administration
Unequality  martial law  segregation
False hood  false teaching  false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us  they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey  Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image if we were swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life  but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long  spiritual life lessons
That I recite with song
Trying to wake up everybody  can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist  Staten Island  stand up  stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah  just you and me

Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin'  striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another  that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum  alaykum as-salam
We want justice  police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast  get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them  translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together  together how we are
To stand with a plan  provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah  just you and me

But I'll hit the blunt  So she took out her fronts  Cracked the Philly  Opened the bag and laid out the skunk  Then I took a long pull  It was hype outta sight  We ran into the bedroom  So I cracked my pants for head room  Later  tossed the covers  And oh  brother! I was wit' it  Ready to hit it  Asked my dick  ""Yo  wassup G?""  ""Yo man  shit's thick""  Licked her down her belly  And kissed her on her back  Stuck my hands between the legs  And I felt the ball sack  As big as mine (Yo!)  This bitch must be craze   So I threw my suit on  And I was Swayze...  'Cause I'm the:   [Chorus]",A Day of Sooperman Lover,1992,Hip Hop

Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true  the makings of you)

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby  caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy  you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy  you remind me  remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys  you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true  these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold  baby; you should know
Baby  you remind me of so much
And  baby  you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims  you shine

Boy  you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around  looking like a superstar
Boy  you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me  and you're my property

Looking at you  looking at another  baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure  baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist  it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips  armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys  you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip  you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine  and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy  you remind me  remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past  all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

J'ai changé d'adresse  de numéro (merci) J'ai balancé tes lettres et tes défauts même si J'ai fait semblant d'avoir trouvé la force Je garde au plus profond de moi tout ce que tu m'as aimée  J'essaye de t'oublier avec un autre Le temps ne semble pas gommer tes fautes J'essaye mais rien n'y fait je ne peux pas  je ne veux pas Je n'y arrive pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi! J'essaye de me soigner avec un autre Qui tente en vain de racheter tes fautes Il semble si parfait mais rien n'y fait je capitule Je ne peux pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi!  Lui  il a tenté de me consoler Même si il n'a pas tes mots ni ton passé C'est vrai mais il n'a pas ton goût pour la fête Pour la nuit  pour les autres  pour tout ce que je hais Il a séché toutes mes larmes  tu sais Il a ramassé mes pots cassés Et il a réglé tous tes impayés  tes impostures  tes ratures Tout ce que tu m'as laissé Il m'aime comme un fou  il me connaît par cœur Il me dit je t'aime parfois durant des heures Mais il ne sent pas ton odeur Pourquoi je te respire dans ses bras Sors de mes pensées!  J'essaye de t'oublier avec un autre Le temps ne semble pas gommer tes fautes J'essaye mais rien n'y fait je ne peux pas  je ne veux pas Je n'y arrive pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi!

Tu me restes comme ça Je veux t'oublier Reprends tes rêves et disparais Car je veux l'aimer comme toi  J'essaye de t'oublier avec un autre Le temps ne semble pas gommer tes fautes J'essaye mais rien n'y fait je ne peux pas  je ne veux pas Je n'y arrive pas  je ne l'aime pas comme toi!

Intro:
A little of this and a little of that (and a little of that) (x4)

Verse 1:
Check it I get the gumtions to make your conjuction function
So honey get it straight or be on your roller blades and skate
My style switch fast like a rash then it get you itchin'
My flow is crisp like a bucket full of Cornnels chicken
I mold the beat like pottery lyrics flow like blood through the artery
With more rhymes then numbers at the lottery
You know my stello have my doe and watch me drop a flow
I wax shit up and make it shine like I was Mop & Glow
So come on baby love let's put it on no fakin' moves
Let's flip on it heads I win and tails you lose
GOT CHA
Grand Puba comes with alladat 
Because I got more game then quarters in the laundry mat
Uh we keep it tight the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me
No doubt cause we hit 'em with...

Hook

Verse 2:
Dig it I got to be one of the baddest brothers on the planet
I'm baggin' honies and they all got bodies just like Janet
I play it save never takin' chickenheads for granded
I'm Superman and Lois takes my rhymes to Daily Planet
I got more promise then timers who makes ? muffins
I do more stickin' in chicken then Stove Top Stuffing
No doubt about it hun I hit from here to China
When I drop the D minor watch me soggy your vagina
Grand Puba  Stud Doogie droppin' clonkite
Prefer the chocolate like the outside of a Klondike
That's how it go and tha'ts the way it's designed
So you can Stoke Me Down I don't mind
We keep it tight and that's the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

Yo man  I'm living grandiose  puffin on an Ambassador
Paid in full  kill the bull  like a matador
Flash the cash  make my album cover shinier
My head's spinning like a discus  and if this is (Just a little samba)
Then I'm straight  with the seven-course meal on my plate
I put my leftovers in the doggie bag
I got moves like Mr. Miyagi had
With the ""wax off  wax on "" I'll play you like Zaxxon
Girls love my songs  sunbathing on the back lawn
""Ju-look-mahvellous""
C'mon young lady  get in the car with us  superstar deluxe (hey!)
I'm always animated cause my game's so tight  that I keep it laminated
Well  if that's true  why you living with ya mama?
Shh! It's just a little samba

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)

No you don't (huh?)

You might spot me in Versace suits
When I'm at award shows paparazzi shoot
I own a fly home  four-car garage
With rides for me and my entourage
Hold up  I got a email
It's a female
Girls pressing on me like Lee Nail
I make the hits that you hear on the jukebox (so?)
Chicks come hotter than Arizona rooftops

I got this one  she's a Playmate
When I met her she was looking at my gold Dizzy nameplate
But I had to vacate  I said ""I'm gonna miss our date cause my plane's late"" (Plane?)
Yeah  I own a plane and I also bought a yacht
So I scuba in Bermuda when the weather gets hot
And I travel a lot
The why you livin' with ya mama?
Man  it's just a little samba!

This is just a little samba
With all the typical drama
Feel the rhythm of the conga (Come on)
This is just a little samba

I make all the money

No you don't (huh?)
No you don't (what?)
No you don't!

1419,"Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in  there's no turnin back
Initiation  manhoods are tested
Do crime  you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line  cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him  you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block  they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere  just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams  nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo  while you're sweepin the streets  does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action  they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You want to live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died  so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste",A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,2001,Hip Hop

1424,"From where you are
You see the smoke start to arise
Where they play cards
And you walk over
Softly moving passed the guards
The stakes are getting higher
You can feel it in your heart
He calls you bluff
He is the ace you never thought
He played that much
And now it's more than all this cards
You want to touch
You never know if winning this
Could really be enough

Take a look
Beyond the moon
You see the stars.
And when you look around
You know the room by heart

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed  dreamed a night like this

How many times
Have I been waiting by the door
To hear these chimes
To hear that someone debonaire has just a arrived
And opened up to see
My world before my eyes
That silhouette creates an image
On the night I can't forget
It has the scent of something special
I can't rest
If I resist temptation
Oh  I know for sure that I will lose the bet

I walk away and suddenly it seems
I'm not alone
In front of me he stands
I stop  before he goes

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it
I have never dreamed  dreamed a night like this

I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it

1429,"Qu'est ce qui nous est arrivé ? 
Pour qu'on ait même plus rien à se raconter ? 
On a vécu tant de choses 
Et pourtant aujourd'hui tout nous oppose 
Tu me dis qu'on n'a pas le même 
Destin  pas les mêmes 
Projets  qu'on n'attend pas les mêmes choses de la vie 
Qu'il vaut mieux qu'on se laisse 
Et que chacun reprenne 
Le cours de sa vie  c'est mieux ainsi.

Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour 
On se dise qu'on a fait le tour 
Et qu'on se laisse avec le blues 
Je me dis 
Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour 
On se dise qu'on a fait le tour ...

Je nous croyais invincibles 
Mais sur terre tout peut s'effondrer même les Twins
C'est si fort et si fragile 
Parce qu'on s'aime pour le meilleur
Mais jamais pour le pire 
Tu me dis qu'on n'a pas le même 
Destin  pas les mêmes
Projets  qu'on n'attend pas les mêmes choses de la vie 
Qu'il vaut mieux qu'on se laisse 
Et que chacun reprenne 
le cours de sa vie  c'est mieux ainsi.

Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour 
On se dise qu'on a fait le tour 
Et qu'on se laisse avec le blues 
Je me dis 
Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour 
On se dise qu'on a fait le tour ...

Alors un jour on s'aime 
Puis on se dit "" jamais sans toi ""
On s'aime à croire que c'est 
Pour la vie 
Mais peut être pas

Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour 
On se dise qu'on a fait le tour 
Et qu'on se laisse avec le blues 
Je me dis 
Et puis à quoi bon l'amour 
Si c'est pour qu'un beau jour 
On se dise qu'on a fait le tour ...",A Quoi Bon l'Amour,2006,Hip Hop
